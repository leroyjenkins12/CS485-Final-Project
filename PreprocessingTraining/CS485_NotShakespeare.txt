, False,,Out of our evil seek to bring forth good
, False,,Our labor must be to pervert that end
, False,,And out of good still to find means of evil
, False,,Which oft times may succeed so as perhaps
, False,,Shall grieve him if I fail not and disturb

, False,,His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
, False,,Back to the gates of Heaven The sulfurous hail
, False,,Shot after us in storm overblown hath laid
, False,,The fiery Surge that from the precipice
, False,,Of Heaven received us falling and the thunder
, False,,Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage
, False,,Perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
, False,,To bellow through the vast and boundless deep
, False,,Let us not slip the occasion whether scorn
, False,,Or satiate fury yield it from our foe
, False,,Seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild
, False,,The seat of desolation void of light
, False,,Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
, False,,Casts pale and dreadful Thither let us tend
, False,,From off the tossing of these fiery waves
, False,,There rest if any rest can harbor there
, False,,And reassembling our afflicted powers
, False,,Consult how we may henceforth most offend
, False,,Our enemy our own loss how repair
, False,,How overcome this dire calamity
, False,,What reinforcement we may gain from hope
, False,,If not what resolution from despair
, False,,Thus Satan talking to his nearest mate
, False,,With head uplift above the wave and eyes
, False,,That sparkling blazed his other parts besides
, False,,Prone on the flood extended long and large
, False,,Lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
, False,,As whom the fables name of monstrous size
, False,,Titanian or Earthborn that war’s on Jove

, False,,And high permission of allruling Heaven
, False,,Left him at large to his own dark designs
, False,,That with reiterated crimes he might
, False,,Heap on himself damnation while he sought
, False,,Evil to others and enraged might see
, False,,How all his malice served but to bring forth
, False,,Infinite goodness grace and mercy shown
, False,,On man by him seduced but on himself

, False,,His mighty stature on each hand the flames
, False,,Driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled
, False,,In billows leave in the midst a horrid vale
, False,,Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
, False,,Aloft incumbent on the dusky air
, False,,That felt unusual weight till on dry Land
, False,,He lights if it were land that ever burned
, False,,With solid as the lake with liquid fire
, False,,And such appeared in hue as when the force
, False,,Of subterranean wind transports a hill
, False,,Torn from Pelorus or the shattered side

, False,,Better to reign in Hell then serve in Heaven
, False,,But wherefore let we then our faithful friends
, False,,The associates and copartners of our loss
, False,,Lie thus astonished on the oblivious pool
, False,,And call them not to share with us their part
, False,,In this unhappy mansion or once more
, False,,With rallied arms to try what may be yet
, False,,Regained in Heaven or what more lost in Hell
, False,,So Satan spake and him Beelzebub
, False,,Thus answered Leader of those armies bright
, False,,Which but the Omnipotent none could have foiled

, False,,Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
, False,,At evening from the top of Fesole
, False,,Or in Valdarno to descry new lands
, False,,Rivers or mountains in her spotty globe
, False,,His Spear to equal which the tallest pine
, False,,Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
, False,,Of some great admiral were but a wand
, False,,He walked with to support uneasy steps
, False,,Over the burning marle not like those steps
, False,,On Heaven’s azure and the torrid clime
, False,,Smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire
, False,,Nathless he so endured till on the beach
, False,,Of that inflamed sea he stood and called
, False,,His Legions angel forms who lay entranced
, False,,Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks
, False,,In Vallombrosa where the Etrurian shades

, False,,In shape and gesture proudly eminent
, False,,Stood like a tower his form had yet not lost
, False,,All her original brightness nor appeared
, False,,Less then archangel ruined and the excess
, False,,Of glory obscured As when the sun new risen
, False,,Looks through the horizontal misty air
, False,,Shorn of his beams or from behind the moon
, False,,In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
, False,,On half the nations and with fear of change
, False,,Perplexes monarchs Darkened so yet shone

, False,,Waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast
, False,,Signs of remorse and passion to behold
, False,,The fellows of his crime the followers rather
, False,,Far other once beheld in bliss condemned
, False,,For ever now to have their lot in pain
, False,,Millions of spirits for his fault amerced
, False,,Of Heaven and from eternal splendors flung
, False,,For his revolt yet faithful how they stood
, False,,Their glory withered As when Heaven’s fire
, False,,Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines
, False,,With singed top their stately growth though bare
, False,,Stands on the blasted heath He now prepared
, False,,To speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
, False,,From wing to wing and half enclose him round
, False,,With all his peers attention held them mute
, False,,Thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn
, False,,Tears such as angels weep burst forth at last
, False,,Words interwove with sighs found out their way
, False,,Oh Myriads of immortal spirits Oh powers
, False,,Matchless but with the Almighty and that strife
, False,,Was not inglorious though the event was dire
, False,,As this place testifies and this dire change
, False,,Hateful to utter but what power of mind
, False,,Foreseeing or presaging from the depth
, False,,Of knowledge past or present could have feared
, False,,How such united force of gods how such
, False,,As stood like these could ever know repulse
, False,,For who can yet believe though after loss
, False,,That all these puissant Legions whose ele
, False,,Hath emptied Heaven shall fail to reascend
, False,,Selfraised and repossess their native seat
, False,,For me be witness all the host of Heaven
, False,,If counsels different or danger shunned
, False,,By me have lost our hopes But he who reigns
, False,,Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure
, False,,Sat on his throne upheld by old repute
, False,,Consent or custom and his regal state
, False,,Put forth at full but still his strength concealed
, False,,Which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall
, False,,Henceforth his might we know and know our own
, False,,So as not either to provoke or dread
, False,,New war provoked our better part remains
, False,,To work in close design by fraud or guile
, False,,What force effected not that he no less
, False,,At length from us may find who overcomes
, False,,By force hath overcome but half his foe
, False,,Space may produce new worlds whereof so rife
, False,,There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long
, False,,Intended to create and therein plant
, False,,A generation whom his choice regard
, False,,Should favor equal to the sons of Heaven
, False,,Thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
, False,,Our first eruption thither or elsewhere
, False,,For this infernal pit shall never hold
, False,,Celestial spirits in bondage nor the abyss
, False,,Long under darkness cover But these thoughts
, False,,Full counsel must mature Peace is despaired
, False,,For who can think submission War then war
, False,,Open or understood must be resolved
, False,,He spake and to confirm his words outflew
, False,,Millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
, False,,Of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze
, False,,Far round illumined hell highly they raged
, False,,Against the Highest and fierce with grasped arms
, False,,Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war
, False,,Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven
, False,,There stood a Hill not far whose grisly top
, False,,Belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
, False,,Shone with a glossy scurf undoubted sign
, False,,That in his womb was hid metallic ore
, False,,The work of sulfur Thither winged with speed
, False,,A numerous brigade hastened As when bands
, False,,Of pioneers with spade and pickax armed
, False,,Forerun the royal camp to trench a field
, False,,Or cast a rampart Mammon led them on
, False,,Mammon the least erected spirit that fell
, False,,From Heaven for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts
, False,,Were always downward bent admiring more
, False,,The riches of Heavens pavement trodden gold
, False,,Then aught divine or holy else enjoyed
, False,,In vision beatific by him first
, False,,Men also and by his suggestion taught
, False,,Ransacked the center and with impious hands
, False,,Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth
, False,,For treasures better hid Soon had his crew
, False,,Opened into the hill a spacious wound
, False,,And digged out ribs of gold Let none admire
, False,,That riches grow in Hell that soil may best
, False,,Deserve the precious bane And here let those
, False,,Who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
, False,,Of Babel and the works of Memphian kings
, False,,Learn how their greatest monuments of fame
, False,,And strength and art are easily outdone
, False,,By spirits reprobate and in an hour
, False,,What in an age they with incessant toil
, False,,And hands innumerable scarce perform
, False,,Nigh on the plain in many cells prepared
, False,,That underneath had veins of liquid fire
, False,,Sluiced from the lake a second multitude
, False,,With wondrous art found out the massy ore
, False,,Severing each kind and scummed the bullion dross
, False,,A third as soon had formed within the ground
, False,,A various mould and from the boiling cells
, False,,By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook
, False,,As in an organ from one blast of wind
, False,,To many a row of pipes the soundboard breaths
, False,,Anon out of the earth a fabric huge
, False,,Rose like an exhalation with the sound
, False,,Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet
, False,,Built like a temple where pilasters round
, False,,Were set and doric pillars overlaid
, False,,With golden architrave nor did there want
, False,,Cornice or freeze with bossy sculptures graven
, False,,The roof was fretted gold Not Babylon
, False,,Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
, False,,Equaled in all their glories to inshrine
, False,,Belus or Serapis their gods or seat
, False,,Their kings when Egypt with Assyria strove
, False,,In wealth and luxury the ascending pile
, False,,Stood fixed her stately heighth and strait the doors
, False,,Opening their brazen folds discover wide
, False,,Within her ample spaces over the smooth
, False,,And level pavement from the arched roof
, False,,Pendant by subtle magic many a row
, False,,Of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
, False,,With naphtha and asphaltus yielded light
, False,,As from a sky The hasty multitude
, False,,Admiring entered and the work some praise
, False,,And some the architect his hand was known
, False,,In Heaven by many a towered structure high
, False,,Where sceptered angels held their residence
, False,,And sat as princes whom the supreme King
, False,,Exalted to such power and gave to rule
, False,,Each in his hierarchy the orders bright
, False,,Nor was his name unheard or unadored
, False,,In ancient Greece and in Ausonian land
, False,,Men called him Mulciber and how he fell
, False,,From Heaven they fabled thrown by angry Jove
, False,,Sheer over the crystal battlements from morn
, False,,To noon he fell from noon to dewy eve
, False,,A summer’s day and with the setting sun
, False,,Dropt from the zenith like a falling star
, False,,On Lemnos the Aegean isle thus they relate
, False,,Erring for he with this rebellious rout
, False,,Fell long before nor aught availed him now
, False,,To have built in Heaven high towers nor did he escape
, False,,By all his engines but was headlong sent
, False,,With his industrious crew to build in hell
, False,,Mean while the winged heralds by command
, False,,Of sovran power with awful ceremony
, False,,And trumpets sound throughout the host proclaim
, False,,A solemn council forthwith to be held
, False,,At Pandemonium the high capital
, False,,Of Satan and his peers their summons called
, False,,From every band and squared regiment
, False,,By place or choice the worthiest they anon
, False,,With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
, False,,Attended all access was thronged the gates
, False,,And porches wide but chief the spacious hall
, False,,Though like a covered field where champions bold
, False,,Wont ride in armed and at the Soldan’s chair
, False,,Defied the best of Paynim chivalry
, False,,To mortal combat or career with Lance
, False,,Thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air
, False,,Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings As bees
, False,,In spring time when the sun with Taurus rides
, False,,Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
, False,,In clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
, False,,Fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank
, False,,The suburb of their strawbuilt citadel
, False,,New rubbed with baum expatiate and confer
, False,,Their state affairs So thick the aerie crowd
, False,,Swarmed and were straitened till the signal given
, False,,Behold a wonder they but now who seemed
, False,,In bigness to surpass Earth’s giant sons
, False,,Now less then smallest dwarfs in narrow room
, False,,Throng numberless like that Pigmean race
, False,,Beyond the Indian mount or fairy elves
, False,,Whose midnight revels by a forest side
, False,,Or fountain some belated peasant sees
, False,,Or dreams he sees while overhead the moon
, False,,Sits arbitress and nearer to the Earth
, False,,Wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance
, False,,Intent with jocund music charm his ear
, False,,At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds
, False,,Thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms
, False,,Reduced their shapes immense and were at large
, False,,Though without number still amidst the hall
, False,,Of that infernal court But far within
, False,,And in their own dimensions like themselves
, False,,The great seraphic lords and cherubim
, False,,In close recess and secret conclave sat
, False,,A thousand demigods on golden seats
, False,,Frequent and full After short silence then
, False,,And summons read the great consult began
, False,,High on a throne of royal state which far
, False,,Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind
, False,,Or where the gorgeous east with richest hand
, False,,Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold
, False,,Satan exalted sat by merit raised
, False,,To that bad eminence and from despair
, False,,Thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires
, False,,Beyond thus high insatiate to pursue
, False,,Vain war with Heaven and by success untaught
, False,,His proud imaginations thus displayed
, False,,Powers and Dominions Deities of Heaven
, False,,For since no deep within her gulf can hold
, False,,Immortal vigor though oppressed and fallen
, False,,I give not Heaven for lost from this descent
, False,,Celestial virtues rising will appear
, False,,More glorious and more dread than from no fall
, False,,And trust themselves to fear no second fate
, False,,Me though just right and the fixed laws of Heaven
, False,,Did first create your leader next free choice
, False,,With what besides in council or in fight
, False,,Hath been achieved of merit yet this loss
, False,,Thus far at least recovered hath much more
, False,,Established in a safe unenvied throne
, False,,Yielded with full consent The happier state
, False,,In Heaven which follows dignity might draw
, False,,Envy from each inferior but who here
, False,,Will envy whom the highest place exposes
, False,,Foremost to stand against the Thunderers aim
, False,,Your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
, False,,Of endless pain Where there is then no good
, False,,For which to strive no strife can grow up there
, False,,From faction for none sure will claim in Hell
, False,,Precedence none whose portion is so small
, False,,Of present pain that with ambitious mind
, False,,Will covet more With this advantage then
, False,,To union and firm faith and firm accord
, False,,More than can be in Heaven we now return
, False,,To claim our just inheritance of old
, False,,Surer to prosper than prosperity
, False,,Could have assured us and by what best way
, False,,Whether of open war or covert guile
, False,,We now debate Who can advise may speak
, False,,He ceased and next him Moloch sceptered king
, False,,Stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit
, False,,That fought in Heaven now fiercer by despair
, False,,His trust was with the Eternal to be deemed
, False,,Equal in strength and rather than be less
, False,,Cared not to be at all with that care lost
, False,,Went all his fear of God or Hell or worse
, False,,He recked not and these words thereafter spake
, False,,My sentence is for open war Of wiles
, False,,More unexpert I boast not them let those
, False,,Contrive who need or when they need not now
, False,,For while they sit contriving shall the rest
, False,,Millions that stand in arms and longing wait
, False,,The signal to ascend sit lingering here
, False,,Heavens fugitives and for their dwellingplace
, False,,Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame
, False,,The prison of his tyranny who reigns
, False,,By our delay No let us rather choose
, False,,Armed with Hellflames and fury all at once
, False,,Oer Heavens high towers to force resistless way
, False,,Turning our tortures into horrid arms
, False,,Against the Torturer when to meet the noise
, False,,Of his almighty engine he shall hear
, False,,Infernal thunder and for lightning see
, False,,Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
, False,,Among his Angels and his throne itself
, False,,Mixed with Tartarean sulfur and strange fire
, False,,His own invented torments But perhaps
, False,,The way seems difficult and steep to scale
, False,,With upright wing against a higher foe
, False,,Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
, False,,Of that forgetful lake benumb not still
, False,,That in our proper motion we ascend
, False,,Up to our native seat descent and fall
, False,,To us is adverse Who but felt of late
, False,,When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
, False,,Insulting and pursued us through the deep
, False,,With what compulsion and laborious flight
, False,,We sunk thus low The ascent is easy then
, False,,The event is feared Should we again provoke
, False,,Our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
, False,,To our destruction if there be in Hell
, False,,Fear to be worse destroyed What can be worse
, False,,Than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
, False,,In this abhorred deep to utter woe
, False,,Where pain of unextinguishable fire
, False,,Must exercise us without hope of end
, False,,The vassals of his anger when the scourge
, False,,Inexorably and the torturing hour
, False,,Calls us to penance More destroyed than thus
, False,,We should be quite abolished and expire
, False,,What fear we then what doubt we to incense
, False,,His utmost ire which to the height enraged
, False,,Will either quite consume us and reduce
, False,,To nothing this essential happier far
, False,,Than miserable to have eternal being
, False,,Or if our substance be indeed divine
, False,,And cannot cease to be we are at worst
, False,,On this side nothing and by proof we feel
, False,,Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven
, False,,And with perpetual inroads to alarm
, False,,Though inaccessible his fatal throne
, False,,Which if not victory is yet revenge
, False,,He ended frowning and his look denounced
, False,,Desperate revenge and battle dangerous
, False,,To less than gods On the other side up rose
, False,,Belial in act more graceful and humane
, False,,A fairer person lost not Heaven he seemed
, False,,For dignity composed and high exploit
, False,,But all was false and hollow though his tongue
, False,,Dropped manna and could make the worse appear
, False,,The better reason to perplex and dash
, False,,Maturest counsels for his thoughts were low
, False,,To vice industrious but to nobler deeds
, False,,Timorous and slothful Yet he pleased the ear
, False,,And with persuasive accent thus began
, False,,I should be much for open war Oh peers
, False,,As not behind in hate if what was urged
, False,,Main reason to persuade immediate war
, False,,Did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
, False,,Ominous conjecture on the whole success
, False,,When he who most excels in fact of arms
, False,,In what he counsels and in what excels
, False,,Mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
, False,,And utter dissolution as the scope
, False,,Of all his aim after some dire revenge
, False,,First what revenge The towers of Heaven are filled
, False,,With armed watch that render all access
, False,,Impregnable oft on the bordering Deep
, False,,Encamp their legions or with obscure wing
, False,,Scout far and wide into the realm of night
, False,,Scorning surprise Or could we break our way
, False,,By force and at our heels all Hell should rise
, False,,With blackest insurrection to confound
, False,,Heavens purest light yet our great Enemy
, False,,All incorruptible would on his throne
, False,,Sit unpolluted and the ethereal mould
, False,,Incapable of stain would soon expel
, False,,Her mischief and purge off the baser fire
, False,,Victorious Thus repulsed our final hope
, False,,Is flat despair we must exasperate
, False,,The Almighty Victor to spend all his rage
, False,,And that must end us that must be our cure
, False,,To be no more Sad cure for who would lose
, False,,Though full of pain this intellectual being
, False,,Those thoughts that wander through eternity
, False,,To perish rather swallowed up and lost
, False,,In the wide womb of uncreated night
, False,,Devoid of sense and motion And who knows
, False,,Let this be good whether our angry Foe
, False,,Can give it or will ever How he can
, False,,Is doubtful that he never will is sure
, False,,Will he so wise let loose at once his ire
, False,,Belike through impotence or unaware
, False,,To give his enemies their wish and end
, False,,Them in his anger whom his anger saves
, False,,To punish endless Wherefore cease we then
, False,,Say they who counsel war we are decreed
, False,,Reserved and destined to eternal woe
, False,,Whatever doing what can we suffer more
, False,,What can we suffer worse Is this then worst
, False,,Thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms
, False,,What when we fled amain pursued and struck
, False,,With Heavens afflicting thunder and besought
, False,,The Deep to shelter us This Hell then seemed
, False,,A refuge from those wounds Or when we lay
, False,,Chained on the burning lake That sure was worse
, False,,What if the breath that kindled those grim fires
, False,,Awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage
, False,,And plunge us in the flames or from above
, False,,Should intermitted vengeance arm again
, False,,His red right hand to plague us What if all
, False,,Her stores were opened and this firmament
, False,,Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire
, False,,Impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
, False,,One day upon our heads while we perhaps
, False,,Designing or exhorting glorious war
, False,,Caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled
, False,,Each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
, False,,Or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
, False,,Under yon boiling ocean wrapped in chains
, False,,There to converse with everlasting groans
, False,,Unrespited unpitied unreprieved
, False,,Ages of hopeless end This would be worse
, False,,War therefore open or concealed alike
, False,,My voice dissuades for what can force or guile
, False,,With him or who deceive his mind whose eye
, False,,Views all things at one view He from Heavens height
, False,,All these our motions vain sees and derides
, False,,Not more almighty to resist our might
, False,,Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles
, False,,Shall we then live thus vile the race of Heaven
, False,,Thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
, False,,Chains and these torments Better these than worse
, False,,By my advice since fate inevitable
, False,,Subdues us and omnipotent decree
, False,,The Victors will To suffer as to do
, False,,Our strength is equal nor the law unjust
, False,,That so ordains This was at first resolved
, False,,If we were wise against so great a foe
, False,,Contending and so doubtful what might fall
, False,,I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
, False,,And venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
, False,,What yet they know must follow to endure
, False,,Ele or ignominy or bonds or pain
, False,,The sentence of their conqueror This is now
, False,,Our doom which if we can sustain and bear
, False,,Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit
, False,,His anger and perhaps thus far removed
, False,,Not mind us not offending satisfied
, False,,With what is punished whence these raging fires
, False,,Will slacken if his breath stir not their flames
, False,,Our purer essence then will overcome
, False,,Their noous vapor or inured not feel
, False,,Or changed at length and to the place conformed
, False,,In temper and in nature will receive
, False,,Familiar the fierce heat and void of pain
, False,,This horror will grow mild this darkness light
, False,,Besides what hope the neverending flight
, False,,Of future days may bring what chance what change
, False,,Worth waiting since our present lot appears
, False,,For happy though but ill for ill not worst
, False,,If we procure not to ourselves more woe
, False,,Thus Belial with words clothed in reasons garb
, False,,Counseled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth
, False,,Not peace and after him thus Mammon spake
, False,,Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven
, False,,We war if war be best or to regain
, False,,Our own right lost Him to unthrone we then
, False,,May hope when everlasting fate shall yield
, False,,To fickle chance and chaos judge the strife
, False,,The former vain to hope argues as vain
, False,,The latter for what place can be for us
, False,,Within Heavens bound unless Heavens Lord supreme
, False,,We overpower Suppose he should relent
, False,,And publish grace to all on promise made
, False,,Of new subjection with what eyes could we
, False,,Stand in his presence humble and receive
, False,,Strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
, False,,With warbled hymns and to his Godhead sing
, False,,Forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
, False,,Our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
, False,,Ambrosial odors and ambrosial flowers
, False,,Our servile offerings This must be our task
, False,,In Heaven this our delight How wearisome
, False,,Eternity so spent in worship paid
, False,,To whom we hate Let us not then pursue
, False,,By force impossible by leave obtained
, False,,Unacceptable though in Heaven our state
, False,,Of splendid vassalage but rather seek
, False,,Our own good from ourselves and from our own
, False,,Live to ourselves though in this vast recess
, False,,Free and to none accountable preferring
, False,,Hard liberty before the easy yoke
, False,,Of servile pomp Our greatness will appear
, False,,Then most conspicuous when great things of small
, False,,Useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
, False,,We can create and in what place soeer
, False,,Thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
, False,,Through labor and endurance This deep world
, False,,Of darkness do we dread How oft amidst
, False,,Thick clouds and dark doth Heavens allruling Sire
, False,,Choose to reside his glory unobscured
, False,,And with the majesty of darkness round
, False,,Covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
, False,,Mustering their rage and Heaven resembles Hell
, False,,As he our darkness cannot we his light
, False,,Imitate when we please This desert soil

, False,,Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
, False,,Magnificence and what can Heaven show more
, False,,Our torments also may in length of time
, False,,Become our elements these piercing fires
, False,,As soft as now severe our temper changed
, False,,Into their temper which must needs remove
, False,,The sensible of pain All things invite
, False,,To peaceful counsels and the settled state
, False,,Of order how in safety best we may
, False,,Compose our present evils with regard
, False,,Of what we are and where dismissing quite
, False,,All thoughts of war Ye have what I advise
, False,,He scarce had finished when such murmur filled
, False,,The assembly as when hollow rocks retain
, False,,The sound of blustering winds which all night long
, False,,Had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
, False,,Seafaring men oerwatched whose bark by chance
, False,,Or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
, False,,After the tempest Such applause was heard
, False,,As Mammon ended and his sentence pleased
, False,,Advising peace for such another field
, False,,They dreaded worse than Hell so much the fear
, False,,Of thunder and the sword of Michael
, False,,Wrought still within them and no less desire
, False,,To found this nether empire which might rise
, False,,By policy and long process of time
, False,,In emulation opposite to Heaven
, False,,Which when Beelzebub perceived than whom
, False,,Satan except none higher sat with grave
, False,,Aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
, False,,A pillar of state Deep on his front engraven
, False,,Deliberation sat and public care
, False,,And princely counsel in his face yet shone
, False,,Majestic though in ruin Sage he stood
, False,,With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
, False,,The weight of mightiest monarchies his look
, False,,Drew audience and attention still as night
, False,,Or summers noontide air while thus he spake
, False,,Thrones and Imperial Powers offspring of Heaven
, False,,Ethereal Virtues or these titles now
, False,,Must we renounce and changing style be called
, False,,Princes of Hell for so the popular vote
, False,,Inclines here to continue and build up here
, False,,A growing empire doubtless while we dream
, False,,And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed
, False,,This place our dungeon not our safe retreat
, False,,Beyond his potent arm to live exempt
, False,,From Heavens high jurisdiction in new league
, False,,Banded against his throne but to remain
, False,,In strictest bondage though thus far removed
, False,,Under the inevitable curb reserved
, False,,His captive multitude For he to be sure

, False,,By our revolt but over Hell extend
, False,,His empire and with iron scepter rule
, False,,Us here as with his golden those in Heaven
, False,,What sit we then projecting peace and war
, False,,War hath determined us and foiled with loss
, False,,Irreparable terms of peace yet none
, False,,Vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
, False,,To us enslaved but custody severe
, False,,And stripes and arbitrary punishment
, False,,Inflicted and what peace can we return
, False,,But to our power hostility and hate
, False,,Untamed reluctance and revenge though slow
, False,,Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
, False,,May reap his conquest and may least rejoice
, False,,In doing what we most in suffering feel
, False,,Nor will occasion want nor shall we need
, False,,With dangerous expedition to invade
, False,,Heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege
, False,,Or ambush from the Deep What if we find
, False,,Some easier enterprise There is a place
, False,,If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
, False,,Err not another world the happy seat
, False,,Of some new race called Man about this time
, False,,To be created like to us though less
, False,,In power and excellence but favored more
, False,,Of him who rules above so was his will
, False,,Pronounced among the gods and by an oath
, False,,That shook Heavens whole circumference confirmed
, False,,Thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
, False,,What creatures there inhabit of what mould
, False,,Or substance how endued and what their power
, False,,And where their weakness how attempted best
, False,,By force of subtlety Though Heaven be shut
, False,,And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure
, False,,In his own strength this place may lie exposed
, False,,The utmost border of his kingdom left
, False,,To their defense who hold it here perhaps
, False,,Some advantageous act may be achieved
, False,,By sudden onset either with Hellfire
, False,,To waste his whole creation or possess
, False,,All as our own and drive as we were driven
, False,,The puny habitants or if not drive
, False,,Seduce them to our party that their God
, False,,May prove their foe and with repenting hand
, False,,Abolish his own works This would surpass
, False,,Common revenge and interrupt his joy
, False,,In our confusion and our joy upraise
, False,,In his disturbance when his darling sons
, False,,Hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
, False,,Their frail original and faded bliss
, False,,Faded so soon Advise if this be worth
, False,,Attempting or to sit in darkness here
, False,,Hatching vain empires Thus Beelzebub
, False,,Pleaded his devilish counsel first devised
, False,,By Satan and in part proposed for whence
, False,,But from the author of all ill could spring
, False,,So deep a malice to confound the race
, False,,Of mankind in one root and Earth with Hell
, False,,To mingle and involve done all to spite
, False,,The great Creator But their spite still serves
, False,,His glory to augment The bold design
, False,,Pleased highly those infernal states and joy
, False,,Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
, False,,They vote whereat his speech he thus renews
, False,,Well have ye judged well ended long debate
, False,,Synod of gods and like to what ye are
, False,,Great things resolved which from the lowest deep
, False,,Will once more lift us up in spite of fate
, False,,Nearer our ancient seat perhaps in view
, False,,Of those bright confines whence with neighboring arms
, False,,And opportune excursion we may chance
, False,,Reenter Heaven or else in some mild zone
, False,,Dwell not unvisited of Heavens fair light
, False,,Secure and at the brightening orient beam
, False,,Purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
, False,,To heal the scar of these corrosive fires
, False,,Shall breathe her balm But first whom shall we send
, False,,In search of this new World whom shall we find
, False,,Sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet
, False,,The dark unbottomed infinite abyss
, False,,And through the palpable obscure find out
, False,,His uncouth way or spread his airy flight
, False,,Upborne with indefatigable wings
, False,,Over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
, False,,The happy Isle What strength what art can then
, False,,Suffice or what evasion bear him safe
, False,,Through the strict sentries and stations thick
, False,,Of angels watching round Here he had need
, False,,All circumspection and we now no less
, False,,Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
, False,,The weight of all and our last hope relies
, False,,This said he sat and expectation held
, False,,His look suspense awaiting who appeared
, False,,To second or oppose or undertake
, False,,The perilous attempt But all sat mute
, False,,Pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
, False,,In others countenance read his own dismay
, False,,Astonished None among the choice and prime
, False,,Of those Heavenwarring champions could be found
, False,,So hardy as to proffer or accept
, False,,Alone the dreadful voyage till at last
, False,,Satan whom now transcendent glory raised
, False,,Above his fellows with monarchal pride
, False,,Conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake
, False,,Oh Progeny of Heaven Empyreal Thrones
, False,,With reason hath deep silence and demur
, False,,Seized us though undismayed Long is the way
, False,,And hard that out of Hell leads up to light
, False,,Our prison strong this huge convex of fire
, False,,Outrageous to devour immures us round
, False,,Ninefold and gates of burning adamant
, False,,Barred over us prohibit all egress
, False,,These passed if any pass the void profound
, False,,Of unessential night receives him next
, False,,Widegaping and with utter loss of being
, False,,Threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf
, False,,If thence he scape into whatever world
, False,,Or unknown region what remains him less
, False,,Than unknown dangers and as hard escape
, False,,But I should ill become this throne Oh Peers
, False,,And this imperial sovereignty adorned
, False,,With splendor armed with power if aught proposed
, False,,And judged of public moment in the shape
, False,,Of difficulty or danger could deter
, False,,Me from attempting Wherefore do I assume
, False,,These royalties and not refuse to reign
, False,,Refusing to accept as great a share
, False,,Of hazard as of honor due alike
, False,,To him who reigns and so much to him due
, False,,Of hazard more as he above the rest
, False,,High honored sits Go therefore mighty powers
, False,,Terror of Heaven though fallen intend at home
, False,,While here shall be our home what best may ease
, False,,The present misery and render Hell
, False,,More tolerable if there be cure or charm
, False,,To respite or deceive or slack the pain
, False,,Of this ill mansion intermit no watch
, False,,Against a wakeful foe while I abroad
, False,,Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
, False,,Deliverance for us all This enterprise
, False,,None shall partake with me Thus saying rose
, False,,The monarch and prevented all reply
, False,,Prudent lest from his resolution raised
, False,,Others among the chief might offer now
, False,,Certain to be refused what erst they feared
, False,,And so refused might in opinion stand
, False,,His rivals winning cheap the high repute
, False,,Which he through hazard huge must earn But they
, False,,Dreaded not more the adventure than his voice
, False,,Forbidding and at once with him they rose
, False,,Their rising all at once was as the sound
, False,,Of thunder heard remote Towards him they bend
, False,,With awful reverence prone and as a god
, False,,Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven
, False,,Nor failed they to express how much they praised
, False,,That for the general safety he despised
, False,,His own for neither do the spirits damned
, False,,Lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
, False,,Their specious deeds on earth which glory excites
, False,,Or close ambition varnished oer with zeal
, False,,Thus they their doubtful consultations dark
, False,,Ended rejoicing in their matchless chief
, False,,As when from mountaintops the dusky clouds
, False,,Ascending while the north wind sleeps oerspread
, False,,Heavens cheerful face the louring element
, False,,Scowls oer the darkened landscape snow or shower
, False,,If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
, False,,Extend his evening beam the fields revive
, False,,The birds their notes renew and bleating herds
, False,,Attest their joy that hill and valley rings
, False,,Oh shame to men Devil with devil damned
, False,,Firm concord holds men only disagree
, False,,Of creatures rational though under hope
, False,,Of heavenly grace and God proclaiming peace
, False,,Yet live in hatred enmity and strife
, False,,Among themselves and levy cruel wars
, False,,Wasting the earth each other to destroy
, False,,As if which might induce us to accord
, False,,Man had not hellish foes enough besides
, False,,That day and night for his destruction wait
, False,,The Stygian council thus dissolved and forth
, False,,In order came the grand infernal peers
, False,,Midst came their mighty paramount and seemed
, False,,Alone the antagonist of Heaven nor less
, False,,Than Hells dread emperor with pomp supreme
, False,,And godlike imitated state him round
, False,,A globe of fiery seraphim enclosed
, False,,With bright emblazonry and horrent arms
, False,,Then of their session ended they bid cry
, False,,With trumpets regal sound the great result
, False,,Toward the four winds four speedy cherubim
, False,,Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
, False,,By heralds voice explained the hollow abyss
, False,,Heard far and wide and all the host of Hell
, False,,With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim
, False,,Thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
, False,,By false presumptuous hope the ranged Powers
, False,,Disband and wandering each his several way
, False,,Pursues as inclination or sad choice
, False,,Leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
, False,,Truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
, False,,The irksome hours till his great chief return
, False,,Part on the plain or in the air sublime
, False,,Upon the wing or in swift race contend
, False,,As at the Olympian games or Pythian fields
, False,,Part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
, False,,With rapid wheels or fronted brigades form
, False,,As when to warn proud cities war appears
, False,,Waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
, False,,To battle in the clouds before each van
, False,,Prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears
, False,,Till thickest legions close with feats of arms
, False,,From either end of heaven the welkin burns
, False,,Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell
, False,,Rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
, False,,In whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild uproar
, False,,As when Alcides from Oechalia crowned
, False,,With conquest felt the envenomed robe and tore
, False,,Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines
, False,,And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
, False,,Into the Euboic sea Others more mild
, False,,Retreated in a silent valley sing
, False,,With notes angelical to many a harp
, False,,Their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
, False,,By doom of battle and complain that Fate
, False,,Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance
, False,,Their song was partial but the harmony
, False,,What could it less when spirits immortal sing
, False,,Suspended Hell and took with ravishment
, False,,The thronging audience In discourse more sweet
, False,,For Eloquence the soul song charms the sense
, False,,Others apart sat on a hill retired
, False,,In thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
, False,,Of providence foreknowledge will and fate
, False,,Fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute
, False,,And found no end in wandering mazes lost
, False,,Of good and evil much they argued then
, False,,Of happiness and final misery
, False,,Passion and apathy and glory and shame
, False,,Vain wisdom all and false philosophy
, False,,Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
, False,,Pain for a while or anguish and excite
, False,,Fallacious hope or arm the obdured breast
, False,,With stubborn patience as with triple steel
, False,,Another part in squadrons and gross bands
, False,,On bold adventure to discover wide
, False,,That dismal world if any clime perhaps
, False,,Might yield them easier habitation bend
, False,,Four ways their flying march along the banks
, False,,Of four infernal rivers that disgorge
, False,,Into the burning lake their baleful streams
, False,,Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate
, False,,Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep
, False,,Cocytus named of lamentation loud
, False,,Heard on the rueful stream fierce Phlegeton
, False,,Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage
, False,,Far off from these a slow and silent stream
, False,,Lethe the river of oblivion rolls
, False,,Her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
, False,,Forthwith his former state and being forgets
, False,,Forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain
, False,,Beyond this flood a frozen continent
, False,,Lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
, False,,Of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
, False,,Thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
, False,,Of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice
, False,,A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
, False,,Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old
, False,,Where armies whole have sunk the parching air
, False,,Burns frore and cold performs the effect of fire
, False,,Thither by harpyfooted Furies haled
, False,,At certain revolutions all the damned
, False,,Are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
, False,,Of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce
, False,,From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
, False,,Their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
, False,,Immovable infixed and frozen round
, False,,Periods of time thence hurried back to fire
, False,,They ferry over this Lethean sound
, False,,Both to and fro their sorrow to augment
, False,,And wish and struggle as they pass to reach
, False,,The tempting stream with one small drop to lose
, False,,In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe
, False,,All in one moment and so near the brink
, False,,But fate withstands and to oppose the attempt
, False,,Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
, False,,The ford and of itself the water flies
, False,,All taste of living wight as once it fled
, False,,The lip of Tantalus Thus roving on
, False,,In confused march forlorn the adventurous bands
, False,,With shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast
, False,,Viewed first their lamentable lot and found
, False,,No rest Through many a dark and dreary vale
, False,,They passed and many a region dolorous
, False,,Oer many a frozen many a fiery alp
, False,,Rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death
, False,,A universe of death which God by curse
, False,,Created evil for evil only good
, False,,Where all life dies death lives and nature breeds
, False,,Perverse all monstrous all prodigious things
, False,,Abominable inutterable and worse
, False,,Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived
, False,,Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire
, False,,Meanwhile the adversary of God and man
, False,,Satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design
, False,,Puts on swift wings and toward the gates of Hell
, False,,Explores his solitary flight sometimes
, False,,He scours the right hand coast sometimes the left
, False,,Now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
, False,,Up to the fiery concave towering high
, False,,As when far off at sea a fleet descried
, False,,Hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
, False,,Close sailing from Bengala or the isles
, False,,Of Ternate and Tidore whence merchants bring
, False,,Their spicy drugs they on the trading flood
, False,,Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
, False,,Ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
, False,,Far off the flying Fiend At last appear
, False,,Hellbounds high reaching to the horrid roof
, False,,And thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass
, False,,Three iron three of adamantine rock
, False,,Impenetrable impaled with circling fire
, False,,Yet unconsumed Before the gates there sat
, False,,On either side a formidable shape
, False,,The one seemed woman to the waist and fair
, False,,But ended foul in many a scaly fold
, False,,Voluminous and vast a serpent armed
, False,,With mortal sting About her middle round
, False,,A cry of Hellhounds neverceasing barked
, False,,With wide Cerberean mouths full loud and rung
, False,,A hideous peal yet when they list would creep
, False,,If aught disturbed their noise into her womb
, False,,And kennel there yet there still barked and howled
, False,,Within unseen Far less abhorred than these
, False,,Vexed Scylla bathing in the sea that parts
, False,,Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore
, False,,Nor uglier follow the nighthag when called
, False,,In secret riding through the air she comes
, False,,Lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
, False,,With Lapland witches while the laboring moon
, False,,Eclipses at their charms The other shape
, False,,If shape it might be called that shape had none
, False,,Distinguishable in member joint or limb
, False,,Or substance might be called that shadow seemed
, False,,For each seemed either black it stood as night
, False,,Fierce as ten furies terrible as Hell
, False,,And shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
, False,,The likeness of a kingly crown had on
, False,,Satan was now at hand and from his seat
, False,,The monster moving onward came as fast
, False,,With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode
, False,,The undaunted fiend what this might be admired
, False,,Admired not feared God and his Son except
, False,,Created thing naught valued he nor shunned
, False,,And with disdainful look thus first began
, False,,Whence and what art thou execrable shape
, False,,That darst though grim and terrible advance
, False,,Thy miscreated front athwart my way
, False,,To yonder gates Through them I mean to pass
, False,,That be assured without leave asked of thee
, False,,Retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof
, False,,Hellborn not to contend with spirits of Heaven
, False,,To whom the goblin full of wrath replied
, False,,Art thou that traitor Angel art thou he

, False,,Of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire
, False,,But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
, False,,Confusedly and which thus must ever fight
, False,,Unless the Almighty Maker them ordain
, False,,His dark materials to create more worlds
, False,,Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend
, False,,Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while

, False,,With loudest vehemence Thither he plies
, False,,Undaunted to meet there whatever power
, False,,Or spirit of the nethermost Abyss
, False,,Might in that noise reside of whom to ask
, False,,Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
, False,,Bordering on light when straight behold the throne
, False,,Of Chaos and his dark pavilion spread
, False,,Wide on the wasteful deep With him enthroned
, False,,Sat sablevested Night eldest of things
, False,,The consort of his reign and by them stood
, False,,Orcus and Ades and the dreaded name
, False,,Of Demogorgon Rumour next and Chance
, False,,And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled
, False,,And Discord with a thousand various mouths
, False,,To whom Satan turning boldly thus Ye powers
, False,,And spirtis of this nethermost Abyss
, False,,Chaos and ancient Night I come no spy
, False,,With purpose to explore or to disturb
, False,,The secrets of your realm but by constraint
, False,,Wandering this darksome desert as my way
, False,,Lies through your spacious empire up to light
, False,,Alone and without guide half lost I seek
, False,,What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
, False,,Confine with Heaven or if some other place
, False,,From your dominion won the Ethereal King
, False,,Possesses lately thither to arrive
, False,,I travel this profound Direct my course
, False,,Directed no mean recompense it brings
, False,,To your behoove if I that region lost
, False,,All usurpation thence expelled reduce
, False,,To her original darkness and your sway
, False,,Which is my present journey and once more
, False,,Erect the standard there of ancient night
, False,,Yours be the advantage all mine the revenge
, False,,Thus Satan and him thus the anarch old
, False,,With faltering speech and visage incomposed
, False,,Answered I know thee stranger who thou art
, False,,That mighty leading angel who of late
, False,,Made head against Heavens King though overthrown
, False,,I saw and heard for such a numerous host
, False,,Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
, False,,With ruin upon ruin rout on rout
, False,,Confusion worse confounded and Heavengates
, False,,Poured out by millions her victorious bands
, False,,Pursuing I upon my frontiers here
, False,,Keep residence if all I can will serve
, False,,That little which is left so to defend
, False,,Encroached on still through our intestine broils
, False,,Weakening the scepter of old Night first Hell
, False,,Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath
, False,,Now lately Heaven and Earth another world
, False,,Hung oer my realm linked in a golden chain
, False,,To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell
, False,,If that way be your walk you have not far
, False,,So much the nearer danger Go and speed
, False,,Havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain
, False,,He ceased and Satan stayed not to reply
, False,,But glad that now his sea should find a shore
, False,,With fresh alacrity and force renewed
, False,,Springs upward like a pyramid of fire
, False,,Into the wild expanse and through the shock
, False,,Of fighting elements on all sides round
, False,,Environed wins his way harder beset
, False,,And more endangered than when Argo passed
, False,,Through Bosporus betwixt the jostling rocks
, False,,Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned
, False,,Charybdis and by the other whirlpool steered
, False,,So he with difficulty and labor hard
, False,,Moved on with difficulty and labor he
, False,,But he once passed soon after when man fell
, False,,Strange alteration Sin and Death amain
, False,,Following his track such was the will of Heaven
, False,,Paved after him a broad and beaten way
, False,,Over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf
, False,,Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length
, False,,From Hell continued reaching the utmost orb
, False,,Of this frail world by which the spirits perverse
, False,,With easy intercourse pass to and fro
, False,,To tempt or punish mortals except whom
, False,,God and good angels guard by special grace
, False,,But now at last the sacred influence
, False,,Of light appears and from the walls of Heaven
, False,,Shoots far into the bosom of dim night
, False,,A glimmering dawn Here nature first begins
, False,,Her farthest verge and chaos to retire
, False,,As from her outmost works a broken foe
, False,,With tumult less and with less hostile din
, False,,That Satan with less toil and now with ease
, False,,Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
, False,,And like a weatherbeaten vessel holds
, False,,Gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn
, False,,Or in the emptier waste resembling air
, False,,Weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
, False,,Far off the empyreal Heaven extended wide
, False,,In circuit undetermined square or round
, False,,With opal towers and battlements adorned
, False,,Of living sapphire once his native seat
, False,,And fast by hanging in a golden chain
, False,,This pendent world in bigness as a star
, False,,Of smallest magnitude close by the moon
, False,,Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge
, False,,Accursed and in a cursed hour he hies
, False,,Hail holy Light offspring of Heaven firstborn
, False,,Or of the Eternal coeternal beam
, False,,May I express thee unblamed since God is light
, False,,And never but in unapproached light
, False,,Dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
, False,,Bright effluence of bright essence increate
, False,,Or hear’st thou rather pure ethereal stream
, False,,Whose fountain who shall tell before the sun
, False,,Before the Heavens thou wert and at the voice
, False,,Of God as with a mantle didst invest
, False,,The rising world of waters dark and deep
, False,,Won from the void and formless infinite
, False,,Thee I revisit now with bolder wing
, False,,Escaped the Stygian pool though long detained
, False,,In that obscure sojourn while in my flight
, False,,Through utter and through middle darkness borne
, False,,With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
, False,,I sung of Chaos and eternal Night
, False,,Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
, False,,The dark descent and up to reascend
, False,,Though hard and rare Thee I revisit safe
, False,,And feel thy sovereign vital lamp but thou
, False,,Revisitst not these eyes that roll in vain
, False,,To find thy piercing ray and find no dawn
, False,,So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs
, False,,Or dim suffusion veiled Yet not the more
, False,,Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
, False,,Clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill
, False,,Smit with the love of sacred song but chief
, False,,Thee Sion and the flowery brooks beneath
, False,,That wash thy hallowed feet and warbling flow
, False,,Nightly I visit nor sometimes forget
, False,,So were I equaled with them in renown
, False,,Thy sovereign command that man should find grace
, False,,Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides
, False,,And Tiresias and Phineus prophets old
, False,,Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
, False,,Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
, False,,Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
, False,,Tunes her nocturnal note Thus with the year
, False,,Seasons return but not to me returns
, False,,Day or the sweet approach of even or morn
, False,,Or sight of vernal bloom or summers rose
, False,,Or flocks or herds or human face divine
, False,,But cloud instead and everduring dark
, False,,Surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
, False,,Cut off and for the  of knowledge fair
, False,,Presented with a universal blank
, False,,Of natures works to me expunged and rased
, False,,And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out
, False,,So much the rather thou celestial Light
, False,,Shine inward and the mind through all her powers
, False,,Irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
, False,,Purge and disperse that I may see and tell
, False,,Of things invisible to mortal sight
, False,,Now had the Almighty Father from above
, False,,From the pure empyrean where he sits
, False,,High throned above all heighth bent down his eye
, False,,His own works and their works at once to view
, False,,About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
, False,,Stood thick as stars and from his sight received
, False,,Beatitude past utterance on his right
, False,,The radiant image of his glory sat
, False,,His only son on earth he first beheld
, False,,Our two first parents yet the only two
, False,,Of mankind in the happy garden placed
, False,,Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love
, False,,Uninterrupted joy unrivalled love
, False,,In blissful solitude he then surveyed
, False,,Hell and the gulf between and Satan there
, False,,Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
, False,,In the dun air sublime and ready now
, False,,To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet
, False,,On the bare outside of this world that seemed
, False,,Firm land imbosomed without firmament
, False,,Uncertain which in ocean or in air
, False,,Him God beholding from his prospect high
, False,,Wherein past present future he beholds
, False,,Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake
, False,,Only begotten Son seest thou what rage
, False,,Transports our Adversary whom no bounds
, False,,Prescribed no bars of Hell nor all the chains
, False,,Heaped on him there nor yet the main abyss
, False,,Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
, False,,On desperate revenge that shall redound
, False,,Upon his own rebellious head And now
, False,,Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
, False,,Not far off Heaven in the precincts of light
, False,,Directly towards the new created world
, False,,And man there placed with purpose to assay
, False,,If him by force he can destroy or worse
, False,,By some false guile pervert and shall pervert
, False,,For man will hearken to his glozing lies
, False,,And easily transgress the sole command
, False,,Sole pledge of his obedience So will fall
, False,,He and his faithless progeny Whose fault
, False,,Whose but his own ingrate he had of me
, False,,All he could have I made him just and right
, False,,Sufficient to have stood though free to fall
, False,,Such I created all the ethereal Powers
, False,,And Spirits both them who stood and them who failed
, False,,Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
, False,,Not free what proof could they have given sincere
, False,,Of true allegiance constant faith or love
, False,,Where only what they needs must do appeared
, False,,Not what they would what praise could they receive
, False,,What pleasure I from such obedience paid
, False,,When will and reason reason also is choice
, False,,Useless and vain of freedom both despoiled
, False,,Made passive both had served necessity
, False,,Not me they therefore as to right belonged
, False,,So were created nor can justly accuse
, False,,Their Maker or their making or their fate
, False,,As if predestination overruled
, False,,Their will disposed by absolute decree
, False,,Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
, False,,Their own revolt not I if I foreknew
, False,,Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault
, False,,Which had no less proved certain unforeknown
, False,,So without least impulse or shadow of fate
, False,,Or aught by me immutably foreseen
, False,,They trespass authors to themselves in all
, False,,Both what they judge and what they choose for so
, False,,I formed them free and free they must remain
, False,,Till they enthrall themselves I else must change
, False,,Their nature and revoke the high decree
, False,,Unchangeable eternal which ordained
, False,,Their freedom they themselves ordained their fall
, False,,The first sort by their own suggestion fell
, False,,Selftempted selfdepraved man falls deceived
, False,,By the other first man therefore shall find grace
, False,,The other none In mercy and justice both
, False,,Through Heaven and Earth so shall my glory excel
, False,,But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine
, False,,Thus while God spake ambrosial fragrance filled
, False,,All Heaven and in the blessed Spirits elect
, False,,Sense of new joy ineffable diffused
, False,,Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
, False,,Most glorious in him all his Father shone
, False,,Substantially expressed and in his face
, False,,Divine compassion visibly appeared
, False,,Love without end and without measure grace
, False,,Which uttering thus he to his Father spake
, False,,Oh Father gracious was that word which closed
, False,,Thy sovereign command that man should find grace
, False,,For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol
, False,,Thy praises with the innumerable sound
, False,,Of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne
, False,,Encompassed shall resound thee ever blest
, False,,For should man finally be lost should man
, False,,Thy creature late so loved thy youngest son
, False,,Fall circumvented thus by fraud though joined
, False,,With his own folly that be from thee far
, False,,That far be from thee Father who art judge
, False,,Of all things made and judgest only right
, False,,Or shall the Adversary thus obtain
, False,,His end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill
, False,,His malice and thy goodness bring to naught
, False,,Or proud return though to his heavier doom
, False,,Yet with revenge accomplished and to Hell
, False,,Draw after him the whole race of mankind
, False,,By him corrupted or wilt thou thyself
, False,,Abolish thy creation and unmake
, False,,For him what for thy glory thou hast made
, False,,So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
, False,,Be questioned and blasphemed without defense
, False,,To whom the great Creator thus replied
, False,,Oh son in whom my soul hath chief delight
, False,,Son of my bosom Son who art alone
, False,,My word my wisdom and effectual might
, False,,All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all
, False,,As my eternal purpose hath decreed
, False,,man shall not quite be lost but saved who will
, False,,Yet not of will in him but grace in me
, False,,Freely vouchsafed once more I will renew
, False,,His lapsed powers though forfeit and enthralled
, False,,By sin to foul exorbitant desires
, False,,Upheld by me yet once more he shall stand
, False,,On even ground against his mortal foe
, False,,By me upheld that he may know how frail
, False,,His fallen condition is and to me owe
, False,,All his deliverance and to none but me
, False,,Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
, False,,Elect above the rest so is my will
, False,,The rest shall hear me call and oft be warned
, False,,Their sinful state and to appease betimes
, False,,The incensed Deity while offered grace
, False,,Invites for I will clear their senses dark
, False,,What may suffice and soften stony hearts
, False,,To pray repent and bring obedience due
, False,,To prayer repentance and obedience due
, False,,Though but endeavored with sincere intent
, False,,Mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut
, False,,And I will place within them as a guide
, False,,My umpire Conscience whom if they will hear
, False,,Light after light well used they shall attain
, False,,And to the end persisting safe arrive
, False,,This my long sufferance and my day of grace
, False,,They who neglect and scorn shall never taste
, False,,But hard be hardened blind be blinded more
, False,,That they may stumble on and deeper fall
, False,,And none but such from mercy I exclude
, False,,But yet all is not done man disobeying
, False,,Disloyal breaks his fealty and sins
, False,,Against the high supremacy of Heaven

, False,,To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
, False,,On hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
, False,,Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams
, False,,But in his way lights on the barren plains
, False,,Of Sericana where Chineses drive
, False,,With sails and wind their cany wagons light
, False,,So on this windy sea of land the Fiend
, False,,Walked up and down alone bent on his prey
, False,,Alone for other creature in this place
, False,,Living or lifeless to be found was none
, False,,None yet but store hereafter from the earth
, False,,Up hither like aerial vapors flew
, False,,Of all things transitory and vain when sin
, False,,With vanity had filled the works of men
, False,,Both all things vain and all who in vain things
, False,,Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
, False,,Or happiness in this or the other life
, False,,All who have their reward on earth the fruits

, False,,Dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
, False,,Till final dissolution wander here
, False,,Not in the neighboring moon as some have dreamed
, False,,Those argent fields more likely habitants
, False,,Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold
, False,,Betwixt the angelical and human kind
, False,,Hither of illjoined sons and daughters born
, False,,First from the ancient world those giants came
, False,,With many a vain exploit though then renowned
, False,,The builders next of Babel on the plain
, False,,Of Sennaar and still with vain design
, False,,New Babels had they wherewithal would build
, False,,Others came single he who to be deemed
, False,,A God leaped fondly into Aetna flames
, False,,Empedocles and he who to enjoy
, False,,Platos Elysium leaped into the sea
, False,,Cleombrotus and many more too long
, False,,Embryos and idiots eremites and friars
, False,,White black and gray with all their trumpery
, False,,Here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
, False,,In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven
, False,,And they who to be sure of Paradise
, False,,Dying put on the weeds of Dominick
, False,,Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
, False,,They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
, False,,And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
, False,,The trepidation talked and that first moved
, False,,And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems
, False,,To wait them with his keys and now at foot
, False,,Of Heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo
, False,,A violent cross wind from either coast
, False,,Blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
, False,,Into the devious air Then might ye see
, False,,Cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tossed
, False,,And fluttered into rags then relics beads
, False,,Indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
, False,,The sport of winds All these upwhirled aloft
, False,,Fly oer the backside of the world far off
, False,,Into a Limbo large and broad since called
, False,,The Paradise of Fools to few unknown
, False,,Long after now unpeopled and untrod
, False,,All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed
, False,,And long he wandered till at last a gleam
, False,,Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
, False,,His traveled steps far distant he descries
, False,,Ascending by degrees magnificent
, False,,Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
, False,,At top whereof but far more rich appeared
, False,,The work as of a kingly palacegate
, False,,With frontispiece of diamond and gold
, False,,Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
, False,,The portal shone inimitable on earth
, False,,By model or by shading pencil drawn
, False,,These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
, False,,Angels ascending and descending bands
, False,,Of guardians bright when he from Esau fled
, False,,To PadanAram in the field of Luz
, False,,Dreaming by night under the open sky
, False,,And waking cried This is the gate of Heaven
, False,,Each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
, False,,There always but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
, False,,Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
, False,,Of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
, False,,Who after came from earth failing arrived
, False,,Wafted by angels or flew oer the lake
, False,,Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
, False,,The stairs were then let down whether to dare
, False,,The Fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
, False,,His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
, False,,Direct against which opened from beneath
, False,,Just oer the blissful seat of Paradise
, False,,A passage down to the Earth a passage wide
, False,,Wider by far than that of aftertimes
, False,,Over mount Sion and though that were large
, False,,Over the Promised Land to God so dear
, False,,By which to visit oft those happy tribes
, False,,On high behests his angels to and fro
, False,,Passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
, False,,From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
, False,,To Beersaba where the Holy Land
, False,,Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore
, False,,So wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
, False,,To darkness such as bound the ocean wave
, False,,Satan from hence now on the lower stair
, False,,That scaled by steps of gold to Heavengate
, False,,Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
, False,,Of all this world at once As when a scout
, False,,Through dark and desert ways with peril gone
, False,,All night at last by break of cheerful dawn
, False,,Obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill
, False,,Which to his eye discovers unaware
, False,,The goodly prospect of some foreign land
, False,,First seen or some renowned metropolis
, False,,With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
, False,,Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
, False,,Such wonder seized though after Heaven seen
, False,,The Spirit malign but much more envy seized
, False,,At sight of all this world beheld so fair
, False,,Round he surveys and well might where he stood
, False,,So high above the circling canopy
, False,,Of nights extended shade from eastern point
, False,,Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
, False,,Andromeda far off Atlantic seas
, False,,Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
, False,,He views in breadth and without longer pause
, False,,Down right into the worlds first region throws
, False,,His flight precipitant and winds with ease
, False,,Through the pure marble air his oblique way
, False,,Amongst innumerable stars that shone
, False,,Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
, False,,Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
, False,,Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
, False,,Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
, False,,Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
, False,,He staid not to inquire Above them all
, False,,The golden sun in splendor likest Heaven
, False,,Allured his eye thither his course he bends
, False,,Through the calm firmament but up or down
, False,,By center or eccentric hard to tell
, False,,Or longitude where the great luminary
, False,,Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
, False,,That from his lordly eye keep distance due
, False,,Dispenses light from far they as they move
, False,,Their starry dance in numbers that compute
, False,,Days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
, False,,Turn swift their various motions or are turned
, False,,By his magnetic beam that gently warms
, False,,The universe and to each inward part
, False,,With gentle penetration though unseen
, False,,Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
, False,,So wondrously was set his station bright
, False,,There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
, False,,Astronomer in the suns lucent orb
, False,,Through his glazed optic tube yet never saw
, False,,The place he found beyond expression bright
, False,,Compared with aught on earth metal or stone
, False,,Not all parts like but all alike informed
, False,,With radiant light as glowing iron with fire
, False,,If metal part seemed gold part silver clear
, False,,If stone carbuncle most or chrysolite
, False,,Ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
, False,,In Aarons breastplate and a stone besides
, False,,Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen
, False,,That stone or like to that which here below
, False,,Philosophers in vain so long have sought
, False,,In vain though by their powerful art they bind
, False,,Volatile Hermes and call up unbound
, False,,In various shapes old Proteus from the sea
, False,,Drained through a limbec to his native form
, False,,What wonder then if fields and regions here
, False,,Breathe forth Elir pure and rivers run
, False,,Potable gold when with one virtuous touch
, False,,The archchemic sun so far from us remote
, False,,Produces with terrestrial humor mixed
, False,,Here in the dark so many precious things
, False,,Of color glorious and effect so rare
, False,,Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
, False,,Undazzled far and wide his eye commands
, False,,For sight no obstacle found here nor shade
, False,,But all sunshine as when his beams at noon
, False,,Culminate from the equator as they now
, False,,Shot upward still direct whence no way round
, False,,Shadow from body opaque can fall and the air
, False,,No where so clear sharpened his visual ray
, False,,To objects distant far whereby he soon
, False,,Saw within ken a glorious angel stand
, False,,The same whom John saw also in the sun
, False,,His back was turned but not his brightness hid
, False,,Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
, False,,Circled his head nor less his locks behind
, False,,Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
, False,,Lay waving round on some great charge employed
, False,,He seemed or fixed in cogitation deep
, False,,Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
, False,,To find who might direct his wandering flight
, False,,To Paradise the happy seat of Man
, False,,His journeys end and our beginning woe
, False,,But first he casts to change his proper shape
, False,,Which else might work him danger or delay
, False,,And now a stripling Cherub he appears
, False,,Not of the prime yet such as in his face
, False,,Youth smiled celestial and to every limb
, False,,Suitable grace diffused so well he feigned
, False,,Under a coronet his flowing hair
, False,,In curls on either cheek played wings he wore
, False,,Of many a colored plume sprinkled with gold
, False,,His habit fit for speed succinct and held
, False,,Before his decent steps a silver wand
, False,,He drew not nigh unheard the angel bright
, False,,Ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned
, False,,Admonished by his ear and straight was known
, False,,The archangel Uriel one of the seven
, False,,Who in Gods presence nearest to his throne
, False,,Stand ready at command and are his eyes
, False,,That run through all the Heavens or down to the Earth
, False,,Bear his swift errands over moist and dry
, False,,Oer sea and land him Satan thus accosts
, False,,Uriel for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
, False,,In sight of Gods high throne gloriously bright
, False,,The first art wont his great authentic will
, False,,Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring
, False,,Where all his sons thy embassy attend
, False,,And here art likeliest by supreme decree
, False,,Like honor to obtain and as his eye
, False,,To visit oft this new creation round
, False,,Unspeakable desire to see and know
, False,,All these his wondrous works but chiefly Man
, False,,His chief delight and favor him for whom
, False,,All these his works so wondrous he ordained
, False,,Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim
, False,,Alone thus wandering Brightest Seraph tell
, False,,In which of all these shining orbs hath man
, False,,His fixed seat or fixed seat hath none
, False,,But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell
, False,,That I may find him and with secret gaze
, False,,Or open admiration him behold
, False,,On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
, False,,Worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured
, False,,That both in him and all things as is meet
, False,,The universal Maker we may praise
, False,,Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
, False,,To deepest Hell and to repair that loss
, False,,Created this new happy race of Men
, False,,To serve him better Wise are all his ways
, False,,So spake the false dissembler unperceived
, False,,For neither man nor angel can discern
, False,,Hypocrisy the only evil that walks
, False,,Invisible except to God alone
, False,,By his permissive will through Heaven and Earth
, False,,And oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
, False,,At wisdoms gate and to simplicity
, False,,Resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
, False,,Where no ill seems Which now for once beguiled
, False,,Uriel though regent of the sun and held
, False,,The sharpestsighted Spirit of all in Heaven
, False,,Who to the fraudulent impostor foul
, False,,In his uprightness answer thus returned
, False,,Fair angel thy desire which tends to know
, False,,The works of God thereby to glorify
, False,,The great Workmaster leads to no excess
, False,,That reaches blame but rather merits praise
, False,,The more it seems excess that led thee hither
, False,,From thy empyreal mansion thus alone
, False,,To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
, False,,Contented with report hear only in Heaven
, False,,For wonderful indeed are all his works
, False,,Pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
, False,,Had in remembrance always with delight
, False,,But what created mind can comprehend
, False,,Their number or the wisdom infinite
, False,,That brought them forth but hid their causes deep
, False,,I saw when at his word the formless mass
, False,,This worlds material mould came to a heap
, False,,Confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
, False,,Stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined
, False,,Till at his second bidding Darkness fled
, False,,Light shone and order from disorder sprung
, False,,Swift to their several quarters hasted then
, False,,The cumbrous elements earth flood air fire
, False,,And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
, False,,Flew upward spirited with various forms
, False,,That rolled orbicular and turned to stars
, False,,Numberless as thou seest and how they move
, False,,Each had his place appointed each his course
, False,,The rest in circuit walls this universe
, False,,Look downward on that globe whose hither side
, False,,With light from hence though but reflected shines
, False,,That place is Earth the seat of Man that light
, False,,His day which else as the other hemisphere
, False,,Night would invade but there the neighboring moon
, False,,So call that opposite fair star her aid
, False,,Timely interposes and her monthly round
, False,,Still ending still renewing through mid Heaven
, False,,With borrowed light her countenance triform
, False,,Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth
, False,,And in her pale dominion checks the night
, False,,That spot to which I point is Paradise
, False,,Adams abode those lofty shades his bower
, False,,Thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires
, False,,Thus said he turned and Satan bowing low
, False,,As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven
, False,,Where honor due and reverence none neglects
, False,,Took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath
, False,,Down from the ecliptic sped with hoped success
, False,,Throws his steep flight in many an aerie wheel
, False,,Nor staid till on Niphates top he lights
, False,,Oh for that warning voice which he who saw
, False,,The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud
, False,,Then when the Dragon put to second rout
, False,,Came furious down to be revenged on men
, False,,Woe to the inhabitants on earth that now
, False,,While time was our first parents had been warned
, False,,The coming of their secret foe and scaped
, False,,Haply so scaped his mortal snare For now
, False,,Satan now first inflamed with rage came down
, False,,The tempter ere the accuser of mankind
, False,,To wreak on innocent frail man his loss
, False,,Of that first battle and his flight to Hell
, False,,Yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
, False,,Far off and fearless nor with cause to boast
, False,,Begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
, False,,Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast
, False,,And like a devilish engine back recoils
, False,,Upon himself horror and doubt distract
, False,,His troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
, False,,The Hell within him for within him Hell
, False,,He brings and round about him nor from Hell
, False,,One step no more than from himself can fly
, False,,By change of place Now conscience wakes despair
, False,,That slumbered wakes the bitter memory
, False,,Of what he was what is and what must be
, False,,Worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue
, False,,Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
, False,,Lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad
, False,,Sometimes towards Heaven and the fullblazing sun
, False,,Which now sat high in his meridian tower
, False,,Then much revolving thus in sighs began
, False,,Oh thou that with surpassing glory crowned
, False,,Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God
, False,,Of this new world at whose sight all the stars
, False,,Hide their diminished heads to thee I call
, False,,But with no friendly voice and add thy name
, False,,Of Sun to tell thee how I hate thy beams
, False,,That bring to my remembrance from what state
, False,,I fell how glorious once above thy sphere
, False,,Till pride and worse ambition threw me down
, False,,Warring in Heaven against Heavens matchless King
, False,,Ah wherefore he deserved no such return
, False,,From me whom he created what I was
, False,,In that bright eminence and with his good
, False,,Upbraided none nor was his service hard
, False,,What could be less than to afford him praise
, False,,The easiest recompense and pay him thanks
, False,,How due yet all his good proved ill in me
, False,,And wrought but malice lifted up so high
, False,,I ‘sdained subjection and thought one step higher
, False,,Would set me highest and in a moment quit
, False,,The debt immense of endless gratitude
, False,,So burdensome still paying still to owe
, False,,Forgetful what from him I still received
, False,,And understood not that a grateful mind
, False,,By owing owes not but still pays at once
, False,,Indebted and discharged what burden then
, False,,Oh had his powerful destiny ordained
, False,,Me some inferior angel I had stood
, False,,Then happy no unbounded hope had raised
, False,,Ambition Yet why not some other Power
, False,,As great might have aspired and me though mean
, False,,Drawn to his part but other Powers as great
, False,,Fell not but stand unshaken from within
, False,,Or from without to all temptations armed
, False,,Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand
, False,,Thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse
, False,,But Heavens free love dealt equally to all
, False,,Be then his love accursed since love or hate
, False,,To me alike it deals eternal woe
, False,,Nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
, False,,Chose freely what it now so justly rues
, False,,Me miserable which way shall I fly
, False,,Infinite wrath and infinite despair
, False,,Which way I fly is Hell myself am Hell
, False,,And in the lowest deep a lower deep
, False,,Still threatening to devour me opens wide
, False,,To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven
, False,,Oh then at last relent Is there no place
, False,,Left for repentance none for pardon left
, False,,None left but by submission and that word
, False,,Disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
, False,,Among the Spirits beneath whom I seduced
, False,,With other promises and other vaunts
, False,,Than to submit boasting I could subdue
, False,,The Omnipotent Ay me they little know
, False,,How dearly I abide that boast so vain
, False,,Under what torments inwardly I groan
, False,,While they adore me on the throne of Hell
, False,,With diadem and scepter high advanced
, False,,The lower still I fall only supreme
, False,,In misery Such joy ambition finds
, False,,But say I could repent and could obtain
, False,,By act of grace my former state how soon
, False,,Would heighth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
, False,,What feigned submission swore Ease would recant
, False,,Vows made in pain as violent and void
, False,,For never can true reconcilement grow
, False,,Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
, False,,Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
, False,,And heavier fall so should I purchase dear
, False,,Short intermission bought with double smart
, False,,This knows my Punisher therefore as far
, False,,From granting he as I from begging peace
, False,,All hope excluded thus behold in stead
, False,,Mankind created and for him this world
, False,,So farewell hope and with hope farewell fear
, False,,Farewell remorse all good to me is lost
, False,,Evil be thou my good by thee at least
, False,,Divided empire with Heavens King I hold
, False,,By thee and more than half perhaps will reign
, False,,As man ere long and this new world shall know
, False,,Thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
, False,,Thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair
, False,,Which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
, False,,Him counterfeit if any eye beheld
, False,,For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
, False,,Are ever clear Whereof he soon aware
, False,,Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm
, False,,Artificer of fraud and was the first
, False,,That practiced falsehood under saintly show
, False,,Deep malice to conceal couched with revenge
, False,,Yet not enough had practiced to deceive
, False,,Uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
, False,,The way he went and on the Assyrian mount
, False,,Saw him disfigured more than could befall
, False,,Spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
, False,,He marked and mad demeanor then alone
, False,,As he supposed all unobserved unseen
, False,,So on he fares and to the border comes
, False,,Of Eden where delicious Paradise
, False,,Now nearer crowns with her enclosure green
, False,,As with a rural mound the champaign head
, False,,Of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
, False,,Access denied and overhead upgrew
, False,,Insuperable height of loftiest shade
, False,,Cedar and pine and fir and branching palm
, False,,A sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend
, False,,Shade above shade a woody theatre
, False,,Of stateliest view Yet higher than their tops
, False,,The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung
, False,,Which to our general sire gave prospect large
, False,,Into his nether empire neighboring round
, False,,And higher than that wall a circling row
, False,,Of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit
, False,,Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
, False,,Appeared with gay enameled colors mixed
, False,,On which the sun more glad impressed his beams
, False,,Than in fair evening cloud or humid bow
, False,,When God hath showered the earth so lovely seemed
, False,,That landscape And of pure now purer air
, False,,Meets his approach and to the heart inspires
, False,,Vernal delight and joy able to drive
, False,,All sadness but despair Now gentle gales
, False,,Fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
, False,,Native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
, False,,Those balmy spoils As when to them who fail
, False,,Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past
, False,,Mozambique off at sea northeast winds blow
, False,,Sabean odors from the spicy shore
, False,,Of Araby the blest with such delay
, False,,Well pleased they slack their course and many a league
, False,,Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles
, False,,So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend
, False,,Who came their bane though with them better pleased
, False,,Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume
, False,,That drove him though enamored from the spouse
, False,,Of Tobits son and with a vengeance sent
, False,,From Media post to Egypt there fast bound
, False,,Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
, False,,Satan had journeyed on pensive and slow
, False,,But further way found none so thick entwined
, False,,As one continued brake the undergrowth
, False,,Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
, False,,All path of man or beast that passed that way
, False,,One gate there only was and that looked east
, False,,On the other side which when the archfelon saw
, False,,Due entrance he disdained and in contempt
, False,,At one flight bound high overleaped all bound
, False,,Of hill or highest wall and sheer within
, False,,Lights on his feet As when a prowling wolf
, False,,Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey
, False,,Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
, False,,In hurdled cotes amid the field secure
, False,,Leaps oer the fence with ease into the fold
, False,,Or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
, False,,Of some rich burgher whose substantial doors
, False,,Crossbarred and bolted fast fear no assault
, False,,In at the window climbs or oer the tiles
, False,,So clomb this first grand thief into Gods fold
, False,,So since into his church lewd hirelings climb
, False,,Thence up he flew and on the tree of life
, False,,The middle tree and highest there that grew
, False,,Sat like a cormorant yet not true life
, False,,Thereby regained but sat devising death
, False,,To them who lived nor on the virtue thought
, False,,Of that lifegiving plant but only used
, False,,For prospect what well used had been the pledge
, False,,Of immortality So little knows
, False,,Any but God alone to value right
, False,,The good before him but perverts best things
, False,,To worst abuse or to their meanest use
, False,,Beneath him with new wonder now he views
, False,,To all delight of human sense exposed
, False,,In narrow room Natures whole wealth yea more
, False,,A Heaven on Earth For blissful Paradise
, False,,Of God the garden was by him in the east
, False,,Of Eden planted Eden stretched her line
, False,,From Auran eastward to the royal towers
, False,,Of great Seleucia built by Grecian kings
, False,,Of where the sons of Eden long before
, False,,Dwelt in Telassar In this pleasant soil
, False,,His far more pleasant garden God ordained
, False,,Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
, False,,All trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste
, False,,And all amid them stood the tree of life
, False,,High eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
, False,,Of vegetable gold and next to life
, False,,Our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by
, False,,Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill
, False,,Southward through Eden went a river large
, False,,Nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
, False,,Passed underneath ingulfed for God had thrown
, False,,That mountain as his gardenmould high raised
, False,,Upon the rapid current which through veins
, False,,Of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn
, False,,Rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
, False,,Watered the garden thence united fell
, False,,Down the steep glade and met the nether flood
, False,,Which from his darksome passage now appears
, False,,And now divided into four main streams
, False,,Runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
, False,,And country whereof here needs no account
, False,,But rather to tell how if Art could tell
, False,,How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks
, False,,Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold
, False,,With mazy error under pendant shades
, False,,Ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
, False,,Flowers worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
, False,,In beds and curious knots but Nature boon
, False,,Poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain
, False,,Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
, False,,The open field and where the unpierced shade
, False,,Imbrowned the noontide bowers Thus was this place
, False,,A happy rural seat of various view
, False,,Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm
, False,,Others whose fruit burnished with golden rind
, False,,Hung amiable Hesperian fables true
, False,,If true here only and of delicious taste
, False,,Betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
, False,,Grazing the tender herb were interposed
, False,,Or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
, False,,Of some irriguous valley spread her store
, False,,Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
, False,,Another side umbrageous grots and caves
, False,,Of cool recess oer which the mantling vine
, False,,Lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
, False,,Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
, False,,Down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake
, False,,That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
, False,,Her crystal mirror holds unite their streams
, False,,The birds their quire apply airs vernal airs
, False,,Breathing the smell of field and grove attune
, False,,The trembling leaves while universal Pan
, False,,Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
, False,,Led on the eternal Spring Not that fair field
, False,,Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers
, False,,Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis
, False,,Was gathered which cost Ceres all that pain
, False,,To seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
, False,,Of Daphne by Orontes and the inspired
, False,,Castalian spring might with this Paradise
, False,,Of Eden strive nor that Nyseian isle
, False,,Girt with the river Triton where old Cham
, False,,Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove
, False,,Hid Amalthea and her florid son
, False,,Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rheas eye
, False,,Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard
, False,,Mount Amara though this by some supposed
, False,,True Paradise under the Ethiop line
, False,,By Nilus head enclosed with shining rock
, False,,A whole days journey high but wide remote
, False,,From this Assyrian garden where the Fiend
, False,,Saw undelighted all delight all kind
, False,,Of living creatures new to sight and strange
, False,,Two of far nobler shape erect and tall
, False,,Godlike erect with native honor clad
, False,,In naked majesty seemed lords of all
, False,,And worthy seemed for in their looks divine
, False,,The image of their glorious Maker shone
, False,,Truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure
, False,,Severe but in true filial freedom placed
, False,,Whence true authority in men though both
, False,,Not equal as their sex not equal seemed
, False,,For contemplation he and velour formed
, False,,For softness she and sweet attractive grace
, False,,He for God only she for God in him
, False,,His fair large front and eye sublime declared
, False,,Absolute rule and hyacinthine locks
, False,,Round from his parted forelock manly hung
, False,,Clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad
, False,,She as a veil down to the slender waist
, False,,Her unadorned golden tresses wore
, False,,Disheveled but in wanton ringlets waved
, False,,As the vine curls her tendrils which implied
, False,,Subjection but required with gentle sway
, False,,And by her yielded by him best received
, False,,Yielded with coy submission modest pride
, False,,And sweet reluctant amorous delay
, False,,Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed
, False,,Then was not guilty shame dishonest shame
, False,,Of natures works honor dishonorable
, False,,Sinbred how have ye troubled all mankind
, False,,With shows instead mere shows of seeming pure
, False,,And banished from mans life his happiest life
, False,,Simplicity and spotless innocence
, False,,So passed they naked on nor shunned the sight
, False,,Of God or angel for they thought no ill
, False,,So hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair
, False,,That ever since in loves embraces met
, False,,Adam the goodliest man of men since born
, False,,His sons the fairest of her daughters Eve
, False,,Under a tuft of shade that on a green
, False,,Stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
, False,,They sat them down and after no more toil
, False,,Of their sweet gardening labor than sufficed
, False,,To recommend cool Zephyr and made ease
, False,,More easy wholesome thirst and appetite
, False,,More grateful to their supperfruits they fell
, False,,Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
, False,,Yielded them sidelong as they sat recline
, False,,On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers
, False,,The savory pulp they chew and in the rind
, False,,Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream
, False,,Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
, False,,Wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
, False,,Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league
, False,,Alone as they About them frisking played
, False,,All beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
, False,,In wood or wilderness forest or den
, False,,Sporting the lion ramped and in his paw
, False,,Dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards
, False,,Gamboled before them the unwieldy elephant
, False,,To make them mirth used all his might and wreathed
, False,,His lithe proboscis close the serpent sly
, False,,Insinuating wove with Gordian twine
, False,,His braided train and of his fatal guile
, False,,Gave proof unheeded others on the grass
, False,,Couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat
, False,,Or bedward ruminating for the sun
, False,,Declined was hasting now with prone career
, False,,To the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
, False,,Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose
, False,,When Satan still in gaze as first he stood
, False,,Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad
, False,,Oh Hell what do mine eyes with grief behold
, False,,Into our room of bliss thus high advanced
, False,,Creatures of other mould earthborn perhaps
, False,,Not Spirits yet to heavenly Spirits bright
, False,,Little inferior whom my thoughts pursue
, False,,With wonder and could love so lively shines
, False,,In them divine resemblance and such grace
, False,,The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured
, False,,Ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
, False,,Your change approaches when all these delights
, False,,Will vanish and deliver ye to woe
, False,,More woe the more your taste is now of joy
, False,,Happy but for so happy ill secured
, False,,Long to continue and this high seat your Heaven
, False,,Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe
, False,,As now is entered yet no purposed foe
, False,,To you whom I could pity thus forlorn
, False,,Though I unpitied League with you I seek
, False,,And mutual amity so strait so close
, False,,That I with you must dwell or you with me
, False,,Henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
, False,,Like this fair Paradise your sense yet such
, False,,Accept your Makers work he gave it me
, False,,Which I as freely give Hell shall unfold
, False,,To entertain you two her widest gates
, False,,And send forth all her kings there will be room
, False,,Not like these narrow limits to receive
, False,,Your numerous offspring if no better place
, False,,Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge
, False,,On you who wrong me not for him who wronged
, False,,And should I at your harmless innocence
, False,,Melt as I do yet public reason just
, False,,Honor and empire with revenge enlarged
, False,,By conquering this new world compels me now
, False,,To do what else though damned I should abhor
, False,,So spake the Fiend and with necessity
, False,,The tyrants plea excused his devilish deeds
, False,,Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
, False,,Down he alights among the sportful herd
, False,,Of those fourfooted kinds himself now one
, False,,Now other as their shape served best his end
, False,,Nearer to view his prey and unespied
, False,,To mark what of their state he more might learn
, False,,By word or action marked About them round
, False,,A lion now he stalks with fiery glare
, False,,Then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
, False,,In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play
, False,,Straight couches close then rising changes oft
, False,,His couchant watch as one who chose his ground
, False,,Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
, False,,Griped in each paw when Adam first of men
, False,,To first of women Eve thus moving speech
, False,,Turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow
, False,,Sole partner and sole part of all these joys
, False,,Dearer thyself than all needs must the Power
, False,,That made us and for us this ample world
, False,,Be infinitely good and of his good
, False,,As liberal and free as infinite
, False,,That raised us from the dust and placed us here
, False,,In all this happiness who at his hand
, False,,Have nothing merited nor can perform
, False,,Aught whereof he hath need he who requires
, False,,From us no other service than to keep
, False,,This one this easy charge of all the trees
, False,,In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
, False,,So various not to taste that only tree
, False,,Of knowledge planted by the tree of life
, False,,So near grows death to life whateer death is
, False,,Some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest
, False,,God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree
, False,,The only sign of our obedience left
, False,,Among so many signs of power and rule
, False,,Conferred upon us and dominion given
, False,,Over all other creatures that possess
, False,,Earth air and sea Then let us not think hard
, False,,One easy prohibition who enjoy
, False,,Free leave so large to all things else and choice
, False,,Unlimited of manifold delights
, False,,But let us ever praise him and extol
, False,,His bounty following our delightful task
, False,,To prune these growing plants and tend these flowers
, False,,Which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet
, False,,To whom thus Eve replied Oh thou for whom
, False,,And from whom I was formed flesh of thy flesh
, False,,And without whom am to no end my guide
, False,,And head what thou hast said is just and right
, False,,For we to him indeed all praises owe
, False,,And daily thanks I chiefly who enjoy
, False,,So far the happier lot enjoying thee
, False,,Preeminent by so much odds while thou
, False,,Like consort to thyself canst no where find
, False,,That day I oft remember when from sleep
, False,,I first awaked and found myself reposed
, False,,Under a shade on flowers much wondering where
, False,,And what I was whence thither brought and how
, False,,Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
, False,,Of waters issued from a cave and spread
, False,,Into a liquid plain then stood unmoved
, False,,Pure as the expanse of Heaven I thither went
, False,,With unexperienced thought and laid me down
, False,,On the green bank to look into the clear
, False,,Smooth lake that to me seemed another sky
, False,,As I bent down to look just opposite
, False,,A shape within the watery gleam appeared
, False,,Bending to look on me I started back
, False,,It started back but pleased I soon returned
, False,,Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
, False,,Of sympathy and love There I had fixed
, False,,Mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire
, False,,Had not a voice thus warned me What thou seest
, False,,What there thou seest fair Creature is thyself
, False,,With thee it came and goes but follow me
, False,,And I will bring thee where no shadow stays
, False,,Thy coming and thy soft embraces he
, False,,Whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy
, False,,Inseparably thine to him shalt bear
, False,,Multitudes like thyself and thence be called
, False,,Mother of human race What could I do
, False,,But follow straight invisibly thus led
, False,,Till I espied thee fair indeed and tall
, False,,Under a platane yet methought less fair
, False,,Less winning soft less amiably mild
, False,,Than that smooth watery image Back I turned
, False,,Thou following cried’st aloud Return fair Eve
, False,,Whom flyest thou whom thou flyest of him thou art
, False,,His flesh his bone to give thee being I lent
, False,,Out of my side to thee nearest my heart
, False,,Substantial life to have thee by my side
, False,,Henceforth an individual solace dear
, False,,Part of my soul I seek thee and thee claim
, False,,My other half With that thy gentle hand
, False,,Seized mine I yielded and from that time see
, False,,How beauty is excelled by manly grace
, False,,And wisdom which alone is truly fair
, False,,So spake our general mother and with eyes
, False,,Of conjugal attraction unreproved
, False,,And meek surrender halfembracing leaned
, False,,On our first father half her swelling breast
, False,,Naked met his under the flowing gold
, False,,Of her loose tresses hid he in delight
, False,,Both of her beauty and submissive charms
, False,,Smiled with superior love as Jupiter
, False,,On Juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
, False,,That shed Mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
, False,,With kisses pure Aside the Devil turned
, False,,For envy yet with jealous leer malign
, False,,Eyed them askance and to himself thus ‘plained
, False,,Sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two
, False,,Imparadised in one anothers arms
, False,,The happier Eden shall enjoy their fill
, False,,Of bliss on bliss while I to Hell am thrust
, False,,Where neither joy nor love but fierce desire
, False,,Among our other torments not the least
, False,,Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines
, False,,Yet let me not forget what I have gained
, False,,From their own mouths All is not theirs it seems
, False,,One fatal tree there stands of knowledge called
, False,,Forbidden them to taste Knowledge forbidden
, False,,Suspicious reasonless Why should their Lord
, False,,Envy them that Can it be sin to know
, False,,Can it be death And do they only stand
, False,,By ignorance Is that their happy state
, False,,The proof of their obedience and their faith
, False,,Oh fair foundation laid whereon to build
, False,,Their ruin hence I will excite their minds
, False,,With more desire to know and to reject
, False,,Envious commands invented with design
, False,,To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
, False,,Equal with Gods aspiring to be such
, False,,They taste and die What likelier can ensue
, False,,But first with narrow search I must walk round
, False,,This garden and no corner leave unspied
, False,,A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
, False,,Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side
, False,,Or in thick shade retired from him to draw
, False,,What further would be learned Live while ye may
, False,,Yet happy pair enjoy till I return
, False,,Short pleasures for long woes are to succeed
, False,,So saying his proud step he scornful turned
, False,,But with sly circumspection and began
, False,,Through wood through waste oer hill oer dale his roam
, False,,Mean while in utmost longitude where Heaven
, False,,With earth and ocean meets the setting sun
, False,,Slowly descended and with right aspect
, False,,Against the eastern gate of Paradise
, False,,Leveled his evening rays It was a rock
, False,,Of alabaster piled up to the clouds
, False,,Conspicuous far winding with one ascent
, False,,Accessible from earth one entrance high
, False,,The rest was craggy cliff that overhung
, False,,Still as it rose impossible to climb
, False,,Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat
, False,,Chief of the angelic guards awaiting night
, False,,About him exercised heroic games
, False,,The unarmed youth of Heaven but nigh at hand
, False,,Celestial armory shields helms and spears
, False,,Hung high with diamond flaming and with gold
, False,,Thither came Uriel gliding through the even
, False,,On a sunbeam swift as a shooting star
, False,,In autumn thwarts the night when vapors fired
, False,,Impress the air and shows the mariner
, False,,From what point of his compass to beware
, False,,Impetuous winds He thus began in haste
, False,,Gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
, False,,Charge and strict watch that to this happy place
, False,,No evil thing approach or enter in
, False,,This day at heighth of noon came to my sphere
, False,,A Spirit zealous as he seemed to know
, False,,More of the Almightys works and chiefly Man
, False,,Gods latest image I described his way
, False,,Bent all on speed and marked his aerie gait
, False,,But in the mount that lies from Eden north
, False,,Where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
, False,,Alien from Heaven with passions foul obscured
, False,,Mine eye pursued him still but under shade
, False,,Lost sight of him One of the banished crew
, False,,I fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
, False,,New troubles him thy care must be to find
, False,,To whom the winged warrior thus returned
, False,,Uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight
, False,,Amid the suns bright circle where thou sits
, False,,See far and wide In at this gate none pass
, False,,The vigilance here placed but such as come
, False,,Well known from Heaven and since meridian hour
, False,,No creature thence If spirit of other sort
, False,,So minded have oerleaped these earthly bounds
, False,,On purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
, False,,Spiritual substance with corporeal bar
, False,,But if within the circuit of these walks
, False,,In whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
, False,,Thou tellest by morrow dawning I shall know
, False,,So promised he and Uriel to his charge
, False,,Returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
, False,,Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
, False,,Beneath the Azores whether the prime orb
, False,,Incredible how swift had thither rolled
, False,,Diurnal or this less voluble earth
, False,,By shorter flight to the east had left him there
, False,,Arraying with reflected purple and gold
, False,,The clouds that on his western throne attend
, False,,Now came still Evening on and Twilight gray
, False,,Had in her sober livery all things clad
, False,,Silence accompanied for beast and bird
, False,,They to their grassy couch these to their nests
, False,,Were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale
, False,,She all night long her amorous descant sung
, False,,Silence was pleased Now glowed the firmament
, False,,With living sapphires Hesperus that led
, False,,The starry host rode brightest till the moon
, False,,Rising in clouded majesty at length
, False,,Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light
, False,,And oer the dark her silver mantle threw
, False,,When Adam thus to Eve Fair Consort the hour
, False,,Of night and all things now retired to rest
, False,,Mind us of like repose since God hath set
, False,,Labor and rest as day and night to men

, False,,Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
, False,,Hitherward bent who could have thought escaped
, False,,The bars of Hell on errand bad no doubt
, False,,Such where ye find seize fast and hither bring
, False,,So saying on he led his radiant files
, False,,Dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
, False,,In search of whom they sought Him there they found
, False,,Squat like a toad close at the ear of Eve
, False,,Assaying by his devilish art to reach
, False,,The organs of her fancy and with them forge
, False,,Illusions as he list phantasms and dreams
, False,,Or if inspiring venom he might taint
, False,,The animal spirits that from pure blood arise
, False,,Like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
, False,,At least distempered discontented thoughts
, False,,Vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires
, False,,Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride
, False,,Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
, False,,Touched lightly for no falsehood can endure
, False,,Touch of celestial temper but returns
, False,,Of force to its own likeness Up he starts
, False,,Discovered and surprised As when a spark
, False,,Lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
, False,,Fit for the tun some magazine to store
, False,,Against a rumored war the smutty grain
, False,,With sudden blaze diffused inflames the air
, False,,So started up in his own shape the Fiend
, False,,Back stepped those two fair angels half amazed
, False,,So sudden to behold the grisly king
, False,,Yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon
, False,,Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell
, False,,Comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed
, False,,Why satst thou like an enemy in wait
, False,,Here watching at the head of these that sleep
, False,,Know ye not then said Satan filled with scorn
, False,,Know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
, False,,For you there sitting where ye durst not soar
, False,,Not to know me argues yourselves unknown
, False,,The lowest of your throng or if ye know
, False,,Why ask ye and superfluous begin
, False,,Your message like to end as much in vain
, False,,To whom thus Zephon answering scorn with scorn
, False,,Think not revolted spirit thy shape the same
, False,,Or undiminished brightness to be known
, False,,As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure
, False,,That glory then when thou no more wast good
, False,,Departed from thee and thou resemblest now
, False,,Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul
, False,,But come for thou be sure shalt give account
, False,,To him who sent us whose charge is to keep
, False,,This place inviolable and these from harm
, False,,So spake the Cherub and his grave rebuke
, False,,Severe in youthful beauty added grace
, False,,Invincible Abashed the devil stood
, False,,And felt how awful goodness is and saw
, False,,Virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
, False,,His loss but chiefly to find here observed
, False,,His luster visibly impaired yet seemed
, False,,Undaunted If I must contend said he
, False,,Best with the best the sender not the sent
, False,,Or all at once more glory will be won
, False,,Or less be lost Thy fear said Zephon bold
, False,,Will save us trial what the least can do
, False,,Single against thee wicked and thence weak
, False,,The Fiend replied not overcome with rage
, False,,But like a proud steed reined went haughty on
, False,,Champing his iron curb To strive or fly
, False,,He held it vain awe from above had quelled
, False,,His heart not else dismayed Now drew they nigh
, False,,The western point where those halfrounding guards
, False,,Just met and closing stood in squadron joined
, False,,A waiting next command To whom their Chief
, False,,Gabriel from the front thus called aloud
, False,,Oh friends I hear the tread of nimble feet
, False,,Hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
, False,,Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade
, False,,And with them comes a third of regal port
, False,,But faded splendor wan who by his gait
, False,,And fierce demeanor seems the Prince of Hell
, False,,Not likely to part hence without contest
, False,,Stand firm for in his look defiance lours
, False,,He scarce had ended when those two approached
, False,,And brief related whom they brought where found
, False,,How busied in what form and posture couched
, False,,To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake
, False,,Why hast thou Satan broke the bounds prescribed
, False,,To thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
, False,,Of others who approve not to transgress
, False,,By thy example but have power and right
, False,,To question thy bold entrance on this place
, False,,Employed it seems to violate sleep and those
, False,,Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss
, False,,To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow
, False,,Gabriel thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise
, False,,And such I held thee but this question asked
, False,,Puts me in doubt Lives there who loves his pain
, False,,Who would not finding way break loose from Hell
, False,,Though thither doomed Thou wouldst thyself no doubt
, False,,And boldly venture to whatever place
, False,,Farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
, False,,Torment with ease and soonest recompense
, False,,Dole with delight which in this place I sought
, False,,To thee no reason who knowest only good
, False,,But evil hast not tried and wilt object
, False,,His will who bounds us Let him surer bar
, False,,His iron gates if he intends our stay
, False,,In that dark durance Thus much what was asked
, False,,The rest is true they found me where they say
, False,,But that implies not violence or harm
, False,,Thus he in scorn The warlike angel moved
, False,,Disdainfully half smiling thus replied
, False,,Oh loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
, False,,Since Satan fell whom folly overthrew
, False,,And now returns him from his prison scaped
, False,,Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
, False,,Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
, False,,Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
, False,,So wise he judges it to fly from pain
, False,,However and to scape his punishment
, False,,So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
, False,,Which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
, False,,Sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell
, False,,Which taught thee yet no better that no pain
, False,,Can equal anger infinite provoked
, False,,But wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
, False,,Came not all hell broke loose or thou than they
, False,,Less hardy to endure Courageous Chief
, False,,The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
, False,,To thy deserted host this cause of flight
, False,,Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
, False,,To which the fiend thus answered frowning stern
, False,,Not that I less endure or shrink from pain
, False,,Insulting angel well thou knowest I stood
, False,,Thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
, False,,The blasting volleyed thunder made all speed
, False,,And seconded thy else not dreaded spear
, False,,But still thy words at random as before
, False,,Argue thy inexperience what behooves
, False,,From hard assays and ill successes past
, False,,A faithful leader not to hazard all
, False,,Through ways of danger by himself untried
, False,,I therefore I alone first undertook
, False,,To wing the desolate abyss and spy
, False,,This new created world whereof in Hell
, False,,Fame is not silent here in hope to find
, False,,Better abode and my afflicted Powers
, False,,To settle here on earth or in mid air
, False,,Though for possession put to try once more
, False,,What thou and thy gay legions dare against
, False,,Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
, False,,High up in Heaven with songs to hymn his throne
, False,,And practiced distances to cringe not fight
, False,,To whom the warrior angel soon replied
, False,,To say and straight unsay pretending first
, False,,Wise to fly pain professing next the spy
, False,,Argues no leader but a liar traced
, False,,Satan and couldst thou faithful add Oh name
, False,,Oh sacred name of faithfulness profaned
, False,,Faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew
, False,,Army of Fiends fit body to fit head
, False,,Was this your discipline and faith engaged
, False,,Your military obedience to dissolve
, False,,Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme
, False,,And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
, False,,Patron of liberty who more than thou
, False,,Once fawned and cringed and servilely adored
, False,,Heavens awful Monarch wherefore but in hope
, False,,To dispossess him and thyself to reign
, False,,But mark what I areed thee now Avaunt
, False,,Fly neither whence thou fledst If from this hour
, False,,Within these hallowed limits thou appear
, False,,Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained
, False,,And seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
, False,,The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred
, False,,So threatened he but Satan to no threats
, False,,Gave heed but wang more in rage replied
, False,,Then when I am thy captive talk of chains
, False,,Proud limitary Cherub but ere then
, False,,Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
, False,,From my prevailing arm though Heavens King
, False,,Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
, False,,Used to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
, False,,In progress through the road of Heaven starpaved
, False,,While thus he spake the angelic squadron bright
, False,,Turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
, False,,Their phalanx and began to hem him round
, False,,With ported spears as thick as when a field
, False,,Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
, False,,Her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
, False,,Sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
, False,,Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
, False,,Prove chaff On the other side Satan alarmed
, False,,Collecting all his might dilated stood
, False,,Like Tenerife or Atlas unremoved
, False,,His stature reached the sky and on his crest
, False,,Sat Horror plumed nor wanted in his grasp
, False,,What seemed both spear and shield Now dreadful deeds
, False,,Might have ensued nor only Paradise
, False,,In this commotion but the starry cope
, False,,Of Heaven perhaps or all the elements
, False,,At least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
, False,,With violence of this conflict had not soon
, False,,The Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
, False,,Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales yet seen
, False,,Betwixt Astraea and the Scorpion sign
, False,,Wherein all things created first he weighed
, False,,The pendulous round earth with balanced air
, False,,In counterpoise now ponders all events
, False,,Battles and realms In these he put two weights
, False,,The sequel each of parting and of fight
, False,,The latter quick up flew and kicked the beam
, False,,Which Gabriel spying thus bespake the Fiend
, False,,Satan I know thy strength and thou knowest mine
, False,,Neither our own but given What folly then
, False,,To boast what arms can do since thine no more
, False,,Than Heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
, False,,To trample thee as mire For proof look up
, False,,And read thy lot in yon celestial sign
, False,,Where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak
, False,,If thou resist The Fiend looked up and knew
, False,,His mounted scale aloft Nor more but fled
, False,,Murmuring and with him fled the shades of night
, False,,Now Morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
, False,,Advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl
, False,,When Adam waked so customed for his sleep
, False,,Was aerielight from pure digestion bred
, False,,And temperate vapors bland which the only sound
, False,,Of leaves and fuming rills Auroras fan
, False,,Lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
, False,,Of birds on every bough so much the more
, False,,His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
, False,,With tresses discomposed and glowing cheek
, False,,As through unquiet rest He on his side
, False,,Leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
, False,,Hung over her enamored and beheld
, False,,Beauty which whether waking or asleep
, False,,Shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
, False,,Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes
, False,,Her hand soft touching whispered thus Awake
, False,,My fairest my espoused my latest found
, False,,Heavens last best gift my ever new delight
, False,,Awake The morning shines and the fresh field
, False,,Calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
, False,,Our tender plants how blows the citron grove
, False,,What drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed
, False,,How nature paints her colors how the bee
, False,,Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet
, False,,Such whispering waked her but with startled eye
, False,,On Adam whom embracing thus she spake
, False,,Oh sole in whom my thoughts find all repose
, False,,My glory my perfection glad I see
, False,,Thy face and morn returned for I this night
, False,,Such night till this I never passed have dreamed
, False,,If dreamed not as I oft am wont of thee
, False,,Works of day past or morrows next design
, False,,But of offence and trouble which my mind
, False,,Knew never till this irksome night Methought
, False,,Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
, False,,With gentle voice I thought it thine It said
, False,,Why sleepest thou Eve now is the pleasant time
, False,,The cool the silent save where silence yields
, False,,To the nightwarbling bird that now awake
, False,,Tunes sweetest his lovelabored song now reigns
, False,,Fullorbed the moon and with more pleasing light
, False,,Shadowy sets off the face of things in vain
, False,,If none regard Heaven wakes with all his eyes
, False,,Whom to behold but thee Natures desire
, False,,In whose sight all things joy with ravishment
, False,,Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze
, False,,I rose as at thy call but found thee not
, False,,To find thee I directed then my walk
, False,,And on methought alone I passed through ways
, False,,That brought me on a sudden to the tree
, False,,Of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed
, False,,Much fairer to my fancy than by day
, False,,And as I wondering looked beside it stood
, False,,One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven
, False,,By us oft seen his dewy locks distilled
, False,,Ambrosia on that tree he also gazed
, False,,And O fair plant said he with fruit surcharged
, False,,edeigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet
, False,,Nor God nor Man Is knowledge so despised
, False,,Or envy or what reserve forbids to taste
, False,,Forbid who will none shall from me withhold
, False,,Longer thy offered good why else set here
, False,,This said he paused not but with venturous arm
, False,,He plucked he tasted me damp horror chilled
, False,,At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold
, False,,But he thus overjoyed O fruit divine
, False,,Sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropped
, False,,Forbidden here it seems as only fit
, False,,For Gods yet able to make Gods of Men
, False,,And why not Gods of Men since good the more
, False,,Communicated more abundant grows
, False,,The author not impaired but honored more
, False,,Here happy creature fair angelic Eve
, False,,Partake thou also happy though thou art
, False,,Happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be
, False,,Taste this and be henceforth among the Gods
, False,,Thyself a Goddess not to earth confined
, False,,But sometimes in the air as we sometimes
, False,,Ascend to Heaven by merit thine and see
, False,,What life the Gods live there and such live thou
, False,,So saying he drew nigh and to me held
, False,,Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
, False,,Which he had plucked the pleasant savory smell
, False,,So quickened appetite that I methought
, False,,Could not but taste Forthwith up to the clouds
, False,,With him I flew and underneath beheld
, False,,The earth outstretched immense a prospect wide
, False,,And various Wondering at my flight and change
, False,,To this high exaltation suddenly
, False,,My guide was gone and I methought sunk down
, False,,And fell asleep but Oh how glad I waked
, False,,To find this but a dream Thus Eve her night
, False,,Related and thus Adam answered sad
, False,,Best image of myself and dearer half
, False,,The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
, False,,Affects me equally nor can I like
, False,,This uncouth dream of evil sprung I fear
, False,,Yet evil whence in thee can harbor none
, False,,Created pure But know that in the soul
, False,,Are many lesser faculties that serve
, False,,Reason as chief among these Fancy next
, False,,Her office holds of all external things
, False,,Which the five watchful senses represent
, False,,She forms imaginations aerie shapes
, False,,Which Reason joining or disjoining frames
, False,,All what we affirm or what deny and call
, False,,Our knowledge or opinion then retires
, False,,Into her private cell when nature rests
, False,,Oft in her absence mimic Fancy wakes
, False,,To imitate her but misjoining shapes
, False,,Wild work produces oft and most in dreams
, False,,Ill matching words and deeds long past or late
, False,,Some such resemblances methinks I find
, False,,Of our last evenings talk in this thy dream
, False,,But with addition strange yet be not sad
, False,,Evil into the mind of God or man
, False,,May come and go so unreproved and leave
, False,,No spot or blame behind Which gives me hope
, False,,That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream
, False,,Waking thou never will consent to do
, False,,Be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks
, False,,That wont to be more cheerful and serene
, False,,Than when fair morning first smiles on the world
, False,,And let us to our fresh employments rise
, False,,Among the groves the fountains and the flowers
, False,,That open now their choicest bosomed smells
, False,,Reserved from night and kept for thee in store
, False,,So cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered
, False,,But silently a gentle tear let fall
, False,,From either eye and wiped them with her hair
, False,,Two other precious drops that ready stood
, False,,Each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
, False,,Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
, False,,And pious awe that feared to have offended
, False,,So all was cleared and to the field they haste
, False,,But first from under shady arborous roof
, False,,Soon as they forth were come to open sight
, False,,Of dayspring and the sun who scarce uprisen
, False,,With wheels yet hovering oer the oceanbrim
, False,,Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray
, False,,Discovering in wide landscape all the east
, False,,Of Paradise and Edens happy plains
, False,,Lowly they bowed adoring and began
, False,,Their orisons each morning duly paid
, False,,In various style for neither various style
, False,,Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
, False,,Their Maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
, False,,Unmeditated such prompt eloquence
, False,,Flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse
, False,,More tunable than needed lute or harp
, False,,To add more sweetness and they thus began
, False,,These are thy glorious works Parent of good
, False,,Almighty Thine this universal frame
, False,,Thus wondrous fair Thyself how wondrous then
, False,,Unspeakable who sits above these heavens
, False,,To us invisible or dimly seen
, False,,In these thy lowest works yet these declare
, False,,Thy goodness beyond thought and power divine
, False,,Speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light
, False,,Angels for ye behold him and with songs
, False,,And choral symphonies day without night
, False,,Circle his throne rejoicing ye in Heaven
, False,,On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol
, False,,Him first him last him midst and without end
, False,,Fairest of stars last in the train of night
, False,,If better thou belong not to the dawn
, False,,Sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn

, False,,And so from Heaven to deepest Hell Oh fall
, False,,From what high state of bliss into what woe
, False,,To whom our great progenitor Thy words
, False,,Attentive and with more delighted ear
, False,,Divine instructor I have heard than when

, False,,Desirous all in circles as they stood
, False,,Tables are set and on a sudden piled
, False,,With angels food and rubied nectar flows
, False,,In pearl in diamond and massy gold
, False,,Fruit of delicious vines the growth of Heaven

, False,,Such are the courts of God the angelic throng
, False,,Dispersed in bands and files their camp extend
, False,,By living streams among the trees of life
, False,,Pavilions numberless and sudden reared
, False,,Celestial tabernacles where they slept
, False,,Fanned with cool winds save those who in their course
, False,,Melodious hymns about the sovereign throne
, False,,Alternate all night long but not so waked
, False,,Satan so call him now his former name
, False,,Is heard no more in Heaven he of the first

, False,,Fit entertainment to receive our King
, False,,The great Messiah and his new commands
, False,,Who speedily through all the hierarchies
, False,,Intends to pass triumphant and give laws

, False,,Or taint integrity But all obeyed
, False,,The wonted signal and superior voice
, False,,Of their great Potentate for great indeed
, False,,His name and high was his degree in Heaven
, False,,His countenance as the morningstar that guides

, False,,So spake the Sovereign Voice and clouds began
, False,,To darken all the hill and smoke to roll
, False,,In dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign
, False,,Of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud
, False,,Ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow
, False,,At which command the Powers militant
, False,,That stood for Heaven in mighty quadrate joined
, False,,Of union irresistible moved on
, False,,In silence their bright legions to the sound
, False,,Of instrumental harmony that breathed
, False,,Heroic ardor to adventurous deeds
, False,,Under their Godlike leaders in the cause
, False,,Of God and his Messiah On they move
, False,,Indissolubly firm nor obvious hill
, False,,Nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides
, False,,Their perfect ranks for high above the ground
, False,,Their march was and the passive air upbore
, False,,Their nimble tread as when the total kind
, False,,Of birds in orderly array on wing
, False,,Came summoned over Eden to receive
, False,,Their names of thee so over many a tract
, False,,Of Heaven they marched and many a province wide
, False,,Tenfold the length of this terrene At last
, False,,Far in the horizon to the north appeared
, False,,From skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched
, False,,In battailous aspect and nearer view
, False,,Bristled with upright beams innumerable
, False,,Of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields
, False,,Various with boastful argument portrayed
, False,,The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
, False,,With furious expedition for they weened
, False,,That selfsame day by fight or by surprise
, False,,To win the mount of God and on his throne
, False,,To set the Envier of his state the proud
, False,,Aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain
, False,,In the mid way Though strange to us it seemed
, False,,At first that angel should with angel war
, False,,And in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
, False,,So oft in festivals of joy and love
, False,,Unanimous as sons of one great Sire
, False,,Hymning the Eternal Father But the shout
, False,,Of battle now began and rushing sound
, False,,Of onset ended soon each milder thought
, False,,High in the midst exalted as a God
, False,,The Apostate in his sunbright chariot sat
, False,,Idol of majesty divine enclosed
, False,,With flaming Cherubim and golden shields
, False,,Then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now
, False,,twixt host and host but narrow space was left
, False,,A dreadful interval and front to front
, False,,Presented stood in terrible array
, False,,Of hideous length Before the cloudy van
, False,,On the rough edge of battle ere it joined
, False,,Satan with vast and haughty strides advanced
, False,,Came towering armed in adamant and gold
, False,,Abdiel that sight endured not where he stood
, False,,Among the mightiest bent on highest deeds
, False,,And thus his own undaunted heart explores
, False,,Oh Heaven that such resemblance of the Highest
, False,,Should yet remain where faith and realty
, False,,Remain not Wherefore should not strength and might
, False,,There fail where virtue fails or weakest prove
, False,,Where boldest though to fight unconquerable
, False,,His puissance trusting in the Almightys aid
, False,,I mean to try whose reason I have tried
, False,,Unsound and false nor is it aught but just
, False,,That he who in debate of truth hath won
, False,,Should win in arms in both disputes alike
, False,,Victor though brutish that contest and foul
, False,,When reason hath to deal with force yet so
, False,,Most reason is that reason overcome
, False,,So pondering and from his armed peers
, False,,Forth stepping opposite halfway he met
, False,,His daring foe at this prevention more
, False,,Incensed and thus securely him defied
, False,,Proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached
, False,,The heighth of thy aspiring unopposed
, False,,The throne of God unguarded and his side
, False,,Abandoned at the terror of thy power
, False,,Or potent tongue Fool not to think how vain
, False,,Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms
, False,,Who out of smallest things could without end
, False,,Have raised incessant armies to defeat
, False,,Thy folly or with solitary hand
, False,,Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
, False,,Unaided could have finished thee and whelmed
, False,,Thy legions under darkness But thou seest
, False,,All are not of thy train there be who faith
, False,,Prefer and piety to God though then
, False,,To thee not visible when I alone
, False,,Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
, False,,From all My sect thou seest now learn too late
, False,,How few sometimes may know when thousands err
, False,,Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
, False,,Thus answered Ill for thee but in wished hour
, False,,Of my revenge first sought for thou returnest
, False,,From flight seditious angel to receive
, False,,Thy merited reward the first assay
, False,,Of this right hand provoked since first that tongue
, False,,Inspired with contradiction durst oppose
, False,,A third part of the Gods in synod met
, False,,Their deities to assert who while they feel
, False,,Vigor divine within them can allow
, False,,Omnipotence to none But well thou comest
, False,,Before thy fellows ambitious to win
, False,,From me some plume that thy success may show
, False,,Destruction to the rest This pause between
, False,,Unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know
, False,,At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
, False,,To heavenly souls had been all one but now
, False,,I see that most through sloth had rather serve
, False,,Ministering Spirits trained up in feast and song
, False,,Such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of Heaven
, False,,Servility with freedom to contend
, False,,As both their deeds compared this day shall prove
, False,,To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied
, False,,Apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find
, False,,Of erring from the path of truth remote
, False,,Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
, False,,Of servitude to serve whom God ordains
, False,,Or Nature God and Nature bid the same
, False,,When he who rules is worthiest and excels
, False,,Them whom he governs This is servitude
, False,,To serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled
, False,,Against his worthier as thine now serve thee
, False,,Thyself not free but to thyself enthralled
, False,,Yet lewdly darest our ministering upbraid
, False,,Reign thou in Hell thy kingdom let me serve
, False,,In Heaven God ever blest and his divine
, False,,Behests obey worthiest to be obeyed
, False,,Yet chains in Hell not realms expect Mean while
, False,,From me returned as erst thou saidst from flight
, False,,This greeting on thy impious crest receive
, False,,So saying a noble stroke he lifted high
, False,,Which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
, False,,On the proud crest of Satan that no sight
, False,,Nor motion of swift thought less could his shield
, False,,Such ruin intercept Ten paces huge
, False,,He back recoiled the tenth on bended knee
, False,,His massy spear upstayed as if on earth
, False,,Winds under ground or waters forcing way
, False,,Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat
, False,,Half sunk with all his pines Amazement seized
, False,,The rebel Thrones but greater rage to see
, False,,Thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout
, False,,Presage of victory and fierce desire
, False,,Of battle Whereat Michael bid sound
, False,,The archangel trumpet through the vast of Heaven
, False,,It sounded and the faithful armies rung
, False,,Hosanna to the Highest Nor stood at gaze
, False,,The adverse legions nor less hideous joined
, False,,The horrid shock Now storming fury rose
, False,,And clamor such as heard in Heaven till now
, False,,Was never arms on armor clashing brayed
, False,,Horrible discord and the madding wheels
, False,,Of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise
, False,,Of conflict over head the dismal hiss
, False,,Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew
, False,,And flying vaulted either host with fire
, False,,So under fiery cope together rushed
, False,,Both battles main with ruinous assault
, False,,And inextinguishable rage All Heaven
, False,,Resounded and had Earth been then all Earth
, False,,Had to her center shook What wonder when
, False,,Millions of fierce encountering angels fought
, False,,On either side the least of whom could wield
, False,,These elements and arm him with the force
, False,,Of all their regions How much more of power
, False,,Army against army numberless to raise
, False,,Dreadful combustion warring and disturb
, False,,Though not destroy their happy native seat
, False,,Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
, False,,From his strong hold of Heaven high overruled
, False,,And limited their might though numbered such
, False,,As each divided legion might have seemed
, False,,A numerous host in strength each armed hand
, False,,A legion led in fight yet leader seemed
, False,,Each warrior single as in chief expert
, False,,When to advance or stand or turn the sway
, False,,Of battle open when and when to close
, False,,The ridges of grim war No thought of flight
, False,,None of retreat no unbecoming deed
, False,,That argued fear each on himself relied
, False,,As only in his arm the moment lay
, False,,Of victory Deeds of eternal fame
, False,,Were done but infinite for wide was spread
, False,,That war and various sometimes on firm ground
, False,,A standing fight then soaring on main wing
, False,,Tormented all the air all air seemed then
, False,,Conflicting fire Long time in even scale
, False,,The battle hung till Satan who that day
, False,,Prodigious power had shown and met in arms
, False,,No equal ranging through the dire attack
, False,,Of fighting Seraphim confused at length
, False,,Saw where the sword of Michael smote and felled
, False,,Squadrons at once with huge twohanded sway
, False,,Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
, False,,Widewasting such destruction to withstand
, False,,He hasted and opposed the rocky orb
, False,,Of tenfold adamant his ample shield
, False,,A vast circumference At his approach
, False,,The great Archangel from his warlike toil
, False,,Surceased and glad as hoping here to end
, False,,Intestine war in Heaven the archfoe subdued
, False,,Or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown
, False,,And visage all inflamed first thus began
, False,,Author of evil unknown till thy revolt
, False,,Unnamed in Heaven now plenteous as thou seest
, False,,These acts of hateful strife hateful to all
, False,,Though heaviest by just measure on thyself
, False,,And thy adherents How hast thou disturbed
, False,,Heavens blessed peace and into nature brought
, False,,Misery uncreated till the crime
, False,,Of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled
, False,,Thy malice into thousands once upright
, False,,And faithful now proved false But think not here
, False,,To trouble holy rest Heaven casts thee out
, False,,From all her confines Heaven the seat of bliss
, False,,Brooks not the works of violence and war
, False,,Hence then and evil go with thee along
, False,,Thy offspring to the place of evil Hell
, False,,Thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils
, False,,Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom
, False,,Or some more sudden vengeance winged from God
, False,,Precipitate thee with augmented pain
, False,,So spake the Prince of angels to whom thus
, False,,The Adversary Nor think thou with wind
, False,,Of aerie threats to awe whom yet with deeds
, False,,Thou canst not Hast thou turned the least of these
, False,,To flight or if to fall but that they rise
, False,,Unvanquished easier to transact with me
, False,,That thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats
, False,,To chase me hence err not that so shall end
, False,,The strife which thou callest evil but we style
, False,,The strife of glory which we mean to win
, False,,Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell
, False,,Thou fablest here however to dwell free
, False,,If not to reign Mean while thy utmost force
, False,,And join him named Almighty to thy aid
, False,,I fly not but have sought thee far and nigh
, False,,They ended parley and both addressed for fight
, False,,Unspeakable for who though with the tongue
, False,,Of angels can relate or to what things
, False,,Liken on earth conspicuous that may lift
, False,,Human imagination to such heighth
, False,,Of Godlike power for likest Gods they seemed
, False,,Stood they or moved in stature motion arms
, False,,Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven
, False,,Now waved their fiery swords and in the air
, False,,Made horrid circles two broad suns their shields
, False,,Blazed opposite while Expectation stood
, False,,In horror From each hand with speed retired
, False,,Where erst was thickest fight the angelic throng
, False,,And left large field unsafe within the wind
, False,,Of such commotion such as to set forth
, False,,Great things by small if natures concord broke
, False,,Among the constellations war were sprung
, False,,Two planets rushing from aspect malign
, False,,Of fiercest opposition in mid sky
, False,,Should combat and their jarring spheres confound
, False,,Together both with next to almighty arm
, False,,Uplifted imminent one stroke they aimed
, False,,That might determine and not need repeat
, False,,As not of power at once nor odds appeared
, False,,In might or swift prevention But the sword
, False,,Of Michael from the armory of God
, False,,Was given him tempered so that neither keen
, False,,Nor solid might resist that edge it met
, False,,The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
, False,,Descending and in half cut sheer nor staid
, False,,But with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared
, False,,All his right side Then Satan first knew pain
, False,,And writhed him to and fro convolved so sore
, False,,The griding sword with discontinuous wound
, False,,Passed through him But the ethereal substance closed
, False,,Not long divisible and from the gash
, False,,A stream of nectarous humor issuing flowed
, False,,Sanguine such as celestial Spirits may bleed
, False,,And all his armor stained ere while so bright
, False,,Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
, False,,By angels many and strong who interposed
, False,,Defense while others bore him on their shields
, False,,Back to his chariot where it stood retired
, False,,From off the files of war There they him laid
, False,,Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
, False,,To find himself not matchless and his pride
, False,,Humbled by such rebuke so far beneath
, False,,His confidence to equal God in power
, False,,Yet soon he healed for Spirits that live throughout
, False,,Vital in every part not as frail man
, False,,In entrails heart of head liver or reins
, False,,Cannot but by annihilating die
, False,,Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
, False,,Receive no more than can the fluid air
, False,,All heart they live all head all eye all ear
, False,,All intellect all sense and as they please
, False,,They limb themselves and color shape or size
, False,,Assume as likes them best condense or rare
, False,,Meanwhile in other parts like deeds deserved
, False,,Memorial where the might of Gabriel fought
, False,,And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
, False,,Of Moloch furious king who him defied
, False,,And at his chariotwheels to drag him bound
, False,,Threatened nor from the Holy One of Heaven
, False,,Refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon
, False,,Down cloven to the waist with shattered arms
, False,,And uncouth pain fled bellowing On each wing
, False,,Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe
, False,,Though huge and in a rock of diamond armed
, False,,Vanquished Adramelec and Asmadai
, False,,Two potent Thrones that to be less than Gods
, False,,Disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight
, False,,Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail
, False,,Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
, False,,The atheist crew but with redoubled blow
, False,,Ariel and Arioch and the violence
, False,,Of Ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew
, False,,I might relate of thousands and their names
, False,,Eternize here on earth but those elect
, False,,Angels contented with their fame in Heaven
, False,,Seek not the praise of men The other sort
, False,,In might though wondrous and in acts of war
, False,,Nor of renown less eager yet by doom
, False,,Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory
, False,,Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell
, False,,For strength from truth divided and from just
, False,,Illaudable naught merits but dispraise
, False,,And ignominy yet to glory aspires
, False,,Vainglorious and through infamy seeks fame
, False,,Therefore eternal silence be their doom
, False,,And now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved
, False,,With many an inroad gored deformed rout
, False,,Entered and foul disorder all the ground
, False,,With shivered armor strown and on a heap
, False,,Chariot and charioteer lay overturned
, False,,And fieryfoaming steeds what stood recoiled
, False,,Oerwearied through the faint Satanic host
, False,,Defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised
, False,,Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
, False,,Fled ignominious to such evil brought
, False,,By sin of disobedience till that hour
, False,,Not liable to fear or flight or pain
, False,,Far otherwise the inviolable Saints
, False,,In cubic phalanx firm advanced entire
, False,,Invulnerable impenetrably armed
, False,,Such high advantages their innocence
, False,,Gave them above their foes not to have sinned
, False,,Not to have disobeyed in fight they stood
, False,,Unwearied unobnoous to be pained
, False,,By wound though from their place by violence moved
, False,,Now Night her course began and over Heaven
, False,,Inducing darkness grateful truce imposed
, False,,And silence on the odious din of war
, False,,Under her cloudy covert both retired
, False,,Victor and vanquished On the foughten field
, False,,Michael and his angels prevalent
, False,,Encamping placed in guard their watches round
, False,,Cherubic waving fires On the other part

, False,,And onward moved embattled When behold
, False,,Not distant far with heavy pace the foe
, False,,Approaching gross and huge in hollow cube
, False,,Training his devilish enginery impaled
, False,,On every side with shadowing squadrons deep
, False,,To hide the fraud At interview both stood
, False,,A while but suddenly at head appeared
, False,,Satan and thus was heard commanding loud
, False,,Vanguard to right and left the front unfold

, False,,So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
, False,,Had ended when to right and left the front
, False,,Divided and to either flank retired
, False,,Which to our eyes discovered new and strange
, False,,A triple mounted row of pillars laid
, False,,On wheels for like to pillars most they seemed
, False,,Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir
, False,,With branches lopped in wood or mountain felled
, False,,Brass iron stony mould had not their mouths
, False,,With hideous orifice gaped on us wide
, False,,Portending hollow truce At each behind
, False,,A Seraph stood and in his hand a reed
, False,,Stood waving tipped with fire while we suspense
, False,,Collected stood within our thoughts amused
, False,,Not long for sudden all at once their reeds
, False,,Put forth and to a narrow vent applied
, False,,With nicest touch Immediate in a flame
, False,,But soon obscured with smoke all Heaven appeared
, False,,From those deepthroated engines belched whose roar
, False,,Emboweled with outrageous noise the air
, False,,And all her entrails tore disgorging foul
, False,,Their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail
, False,,Of iron globes which on the victor host
, False,,Leveled with such impetuous fury smote
, False,,That whom they hit none on their feet might stand
, False,,Though standing else as rocks but down they fell
, False,,By thousands angel on archangel rolled
, False,,The sooner for their arms unarmed they might
, False,,Have easily as Spirits evaded swift

, False,,Foul dissipation followed and forced rout
, False,,Nor served it to relax their serried files
, False,,What should they do if on they rushed repulse
, False,,Repeated and indecent overthrow
, False,,Doubled would render them yet more despised
, False,,And to their foes a laughter for in view
, False,,Stood ranked of Seraphim another row

, False,,Of thunder Back defeated to return
, False,,They worse abhorred Satan beheld their plight
, False,,And to his mates thus in derision called
, False,,Oh Friends why come not on these victors proud
, False,,Ere while they fierce were coming and when we
, False,,To entertain them fair with open front
, False,,And breast what could we more propounded terms
, False,,Of composition straight they changed their minds
, False,,Flew off and into strange vagaries fell
, False,,As they would dance yet for a dance they seemed
, False,,Somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps
, False,,For joy of offered peace But I suppose
, False,,If our proposals once again were heard
, False,,We should compel them to a quick result
, False,,To whom thus Belial in like gamesome mood
, False,,Leader the terms we sent were terms of weight
, False,,Of hard contents and full of force urged home
, False,,Such as we might perceive amused them all
, False,,And stumbled many Who receives them right
, False,,Had need from head to foot well understand
, False,,Not understood this gift they have besides
, False,,They show us when our foes walk not upright
, False,,So they among themselves in pleasant vein
, False,,Stood scoffing heightened in their thoughts beyond
, False,,All doubt of victory Eternal Might
, False,,To match with their inventions they presumed
, False,,So easy and of his thunder made a scorn
, False,,And all his host derided while they stood
, False,,A while in trouble But they stood not long
, False,,Rage prompted them at length and found them arms
, False,,Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose
, False,,Forthwith behold the excellence the power
, False,,Which God hath in his mighty angels placed
, False,,Their arms away they threw and to the hills
, False,,For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
, False,,Of pleasure situate in hill and dale
, False,,Light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew
, False,,From their foundations loosening to and fro
, False,,They plucked the seated hills with all their load
, False,,Rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops
, False,,Uplifting bore them in their hands Amaze
, False,,Be sure and terror seized the rebel host
, False,,When coming towards them so dread they saw
, False,,The bottom of the mountains upward turned
, False,,Till on those cursed engines triplerow
, False,,They saw them whelmed and all their confidence
, False,,Under the weight of mountains buried deep
, False,,Themselves invaded next and on their heads
, False,,Main promontories flung which in the air
, False,,Came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed
, False,,Their armor helped their harm crushed in and bruised
, False,,Into their substance pent which wrought them pain
, False,,Implacable and many a dolorous groan
, False,,Long struggling underneath ere they could wind
, False,,Out of such prison though Spirits of purest light
, False,,Purest at first now gross by sinning grown
, False,,The rest in imitation to like arms
, False,,Betook them and the neighboring hills uptore
, False,,So hills amid the air encountered hills
, False,,Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
, False,,That under ground they fought in dismal shade
, False,,Infernal noise war seemed a civil game
, False,,To this uproar horrid confusion heaped
, False,,Upon confusion rose And now all Heaven
, False,,Had gone to wrack with ruin overspread
, False,,Had not the Almighty Father where he sits
, False,,Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure
, False,,Consulting on the sum of things foreseen
, False,,This tumult and permitted all advised
, False,,That his great purpose he might so fulfill
, False,,To honor his anointed Son avenged
, False,,Upon his enemies and to declare
, False,,All power on him transferred Whence to his Son
, False,,The Assessor of his throne he thus began
, False,,Effulgence of my glory Son beloved
, False,,Son in whose face invisible is beheld
, False,,Visibly what by Deity I am
, False,,And in whose hand what by decree I do
, False,,Second Omnipotence two days are past
, False,,Two days as we compute the days of Heaven
, False,,Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
, False,,These disobedient Sore hath been their fight
, False,,As likeliest was when two such foes met armed
, False,,For to themselves I left them and thou knowest
, False,,Equal in their creation they were formed
, False,,Save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
, False,,Insensibly for I suspend their doom
, False,,Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
, False,,Endless and no solution will be found
, False,,War wearied hath performed what war can do
, False,,And to disordered rage let loose the reins
, False,,With mountains as with weapons armed which makes
, False,,Wild work in Heaven and dangerous to the main
, False,,Two days are therefore past the third is thine
, False,,For thee I have ordained it and thus far
, False,,Have suffered that the glory may be thine
, False,,Of ending this great war since none but Thou
, False,,Can end it Into thee such virtue and grace
, False,,Immense I have transfused that all may know
, False,,In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare
, False,,And this perverse commotion governed thus
, False,,To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
, False,,Of all things to be Heir and to be King
, False,,By sacred unction thy deserved right
, False,,Go then Thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might
, False,,Ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels
, False,,That shake Heavens basis bring forth all my war
, False,,My bow and thunder my almighty arms
, False,,Gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh
, False,,Pursue these sons of darkness drive them out
, False,,From all Heavens bounds into the utter deep
, False,,There let them learn as likes them to despise
, False,,God and Messiah his anointed King
, False,,He said and on his Son with rays direct
, False,,Shone full he all his Father full expressed
, False,,Ineffably into his face received
, False,,And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake
, False,,Oh Father Oh Supreme of heavenly Thrones
, False,,First Highest Holiest Best thou always seekst
, False,,To glorify thy Son I always thee
, False,,As is most just This I my glory account
, False,,My exaltation and my whole delight
, False,,That thou in me well pleased declarest thy will
, False,,Fulfilled which to fulfill is all my bliss
, False,,Scepter and power thy giving I assume
, False,,And gladlier shall resign when in the end
, False,,Thou shalt be all in all and I in thee
, False,,For ever and in me all whom thou lovest
, False,,But whom thou hatest I hate and can put on
, False,,Thy terrors as I put thy mildness on
, False,,Image of thee in all things and shall soon
, False,,Armed with thy might rid Heaven of these rebelled
, False,,To their prepared ill mansion driven down
, False,,To chains of darkness and the undying worm
, False,,That from thy just obedience could revolt
, False,,Whom to obey is happiness entire
, False,,Then shall thy Saints unmixed and from the impure
, False,,Far separate circling thy holy mount
, False,,Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing
, False,,Hymns of high praise and I among them Chief
, False,,So said he oer his scepter bowing rose
, False,,From the right hand of Glory where he sat
, False,,And the third sacred morn began to shine
, False,,Dawning through Heaven Forth rushed with whirlwind sound
, False,,The chariot of Paternal Deity
, False,,Flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn
, False,,Itself instinct with Spirit but convoyed
, False,,By four Cherubic shapes four faces each
, False,,Had wondrous as with stars their bodies all
, False,,And wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
, False,,Of beryl and careering fires between
, False,,Over their heads a crystal firmament
, False,,Whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure
, False,,Amber and colors of the showery arch
, False,,He in celestial panoply all armed
, False,,Of radiant Urim work divinely wrought
, False,,Ascended at his right hand Victory
, False,,Sat eaglewinged beside him hung his bow
, False,,And quiver with threebolted thunder stored
, False,,And from about him fierce effusion rolled
, False,,Of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire
, False,,Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints
, False,,He onward came far off his coming shone
, False,,And twenty thousand I their number heard
, False,,Chariots of God half on each hand were seen
, False,,He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
, False,,On the crystalline sky in sapphire throned
, False,,Illustrious far and wide but by his own
, False,,First seen Them unexpected joy surprised
, False,,When the great ensign of Messiah blazed
, False,,Aloft by angels borne his sign in Heaven
, False,,Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
, False,,His army circumfused on either wing
, False,,Under their Head imbodied all in one
, False,,Before him Power Divine his way prepared
, False,,At his command the uprooted hills retired
, False,,Each to his place they heard his voice and went
, False,,Obsequious Heaven his wonted face renewed
, False,,And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled
, False,,This saw his hapless foes but stood obdured
, False,,And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers
, False,,Insensate hope conceiving from despair
, False,,In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell
, False,,But to convince the proud what signs avail
, False,,Or wonders move the obdurate to relent
, False,,They hardened more by what might most reclaim
, False,,Grieving to see his glory at the sight
, False,,Took envy and aspiring to his heighth
, False,,Stood reembattled fierce by force or fraud
, False,,Weening to prosper and at length prevail
, False,,Against God and Messiah or to fall
, False,,In universal ruin last and now
, False,,To final battle drew disdaining flight
, False,,Or faint retreat when the great Son of God
, False,,To all his host on either hand thus spake
, False,,Stand still in bright array ye saints here stand
, False,,Ye angels armed this day from battle rest
, False,,Faithful hath been your warfare and of God
, False,,Accepted fearless in his righteous cause
, False,,And as ye have received so have ye done
, False,,Invincibly But of this cursed crew
, False,,The punishment to other hand belongs
, False,,Vengeance is his or whose he sole appoints
, False,,Number to this days work is not ordained
, False,,Nor multitude stand only and behold
, False,,Gods indignation on these godless poured
, False,,By me not you but me they have despised
, False,,Yet envied against me is all their rage
, False,,Because the Father to whom in Heaven spreme
, False,,Kingdom and power and glory appertains
, False,,Hath honored me according to his will
, False,,Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned
, False,,That they may have their wish to try with me
, False,,In battle which the stronger proves they all
, False,,Or I alone against them since by strength
, False,,They measure all of other excellence
, False,,Not emulous nor care who them excels
, False,,Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe
, False,,So spake the Son and into terror changed
, False,,His countenance too severe to be beheld
, False,,And full of wrath bent on his enemies
, False,,At once the four spread out their starry wings
, False,,With dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs
, False,,Of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound
, False,,Of torrent floods or of a numerous host
, False,,He on his impious foes right onward drove
, False,,Gloomy as night under his burning wheels
, False,,The steadfast empyrean shook throughout
, False,,All but the throne itself of God Full soon
, False,,Among them he arrived in his right hand
, False,,Grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent
, False,,Before him such as in their souls infixed
, False,,Plagues They astonished all resistance lost
, False,,All courage down their idle weapons dropt
, False,,Oer shields and helms and helmed heads he rode
, False,,Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate
, False,,That wished the mountains now might be again
, False,,Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire
, False,,Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
, False,,His arrows from the fourfoldvisaged Four
, False,,Distinct with eyes and from the living wheels
, False,,Distinct alike with multitude of eyes
, False,,One Spirit in them ruled and every eye
, False,,Glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire
, False,,Among the accursed that withered all their strength
, False,,And of their wonted vigor left them drained
, False,,Exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen
, False,,Yet half his strength he put not forth but checked
, False,,His thunder in mid volley for he meant
, False,,Not to destroy but root them out of Heaven
, False,,The overthrown he raised and as a herd
, False,,Of goats or timorous flock together thronged
, False,,Drove them before him thunderstruck pursued
, False,,With terrors and with furies to the bounds
, False,,And crystal wall of Heaven which opening wide
, False,,Rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed
, False,,Into the wasteful deep The monstrous sight
, False,,Struck them with horror backward but far worse
, False,,Urged them behind Headlong themselves they threw
, False,,Down from the verge of Heaven eternal wrath
, False,,Burnt after them to the bottomless pit
, False,,Hell heard the unsufferable noise Hell saw
, False,,Heaven ruining from Heaven and would have fled
, False,,Affrighted but strict Fate had cast too deep
, False,,Her dark foundations and too fast had bound
, False,,Nine days they fell Confounded Chaos roared
, False,,And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
, False,,Through his wild anarchy so huge a rout
, False,,Incumbered him with ruin Hell at last
, False,,Yawning received them whole and on them closed
, False,,Hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
, False,,Unquenchable the house of woe and pain
, False,,Disburdened Heaven rejoiced and soon repaired
, False,,Her mural breach returning whence it rolled
, False,,Sole victor from the expulsion of his foes
, False,,Messiah his triumphal chariot turned
, False,,To meet him all his Saints who silent stood
, False,,Eyewitnesses of his almighty acts
, False,,With jubilee advanced and as they went
, False,,Shaded with branching palm each Order bright
, False,,Sung triumph and him sung victorious King
, False,,Son Heir and Lord to him dominion given
, False,,Worthiest to reign He celebrated rode
, False,,Triumphant through mid Heaven into the courts
, False,,And temple of his Mighty Father throned
, False,,On high who into glory him received
, False,,Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss
, False,,Thus measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth
, False,,At thy request and that thou mayest beware
, False,,By what is past to thee I have revealed
, False,,What might have else to human race been hid
, False,,The discord which befell and war in Heaven
, False,,Among the angelic Powers and the deep fall
, False,,Of those too high aspiring who rebelled
, False,,With Satan he who envies now thy state
, False,,Who now is plotting how he may seduce
, False,,Thee also from obedience that with him
, False,,Bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake
, False,,His punishment eternal misery
, False,,Which would be all his solace and revenge
, False,,As a despite done against the Most High
, False,,Thee once to gain companion of his woe
, False,,But listen not to his temptations warn
, False,,Thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard
, False,,By terrible example the reward
, False,,Of disobedience firm they might have stood
, False,,Yet fell remember and fear to transgress
, False,,Descend from Heaven Urania by that name
, False,,If rightly thou art called whose voice divine
, False,,Following above the Olympian hill I soar
, False,,Above the flight of Pegasean wing
, False,,The meaning not the name I call for thou
, False,,Nor of the Muses nine nor on the top
, False,,Of old Olympus dwellest but heavenlyborn
, False,,Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed
, False,,Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse
, False,,Wisdom thy sister and with her didst play
, False,,In presence of the Almighty Father pleased
, False,,With thy celestial song Up led by thee
, False,,Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed
, False,,An earthly guest and drawn empyreal air
, False,,Thy tempering with like safety guided down
, False,,Return me to my native element
, False,,Lest from this flying steed unreined as once
, False,,Bellerophon though from a lower clime
, False,,Dismounted on the Aleian field I fall
, False,,Erroneous there to wander and forlorn
, False,,Half yet remains unsung but narrower bound
, False,,Within the visible diurnal sphere
, False,,Standing on earth not rapt above the pole
, False,,More safe I sing with mortal voice unchanged
, False,,To hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days
, False,,On evil days though fallen and evil tongues
, False,,In darkness and with dangers compassed round
, False,,And solitude yet not alone while thou
, False,,Visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn
, False,,Purples the east still govern thou my song
, False,,Urania and fit audience find though few
, False,,But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
, False,,Of Bacchus and his revelers the race
, False,,Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard
, False,,In Rhodope where woods and rocks had ears
, False,,To rapture till the savage clamor drowned
, False,,Both harp and voice nor could the Muse defend
, False,,Her son So fail not thou who thee implores
, False,,For thou art heavenly she an empty dream
, False,,Say Goddess what ensued when Raphael
, False,,The affable archangel had forewarned
, False,,Adam by dire example to beware
, False,,Apostasy by what befell in Heaven
, False,,To those apostates lest the like befall
, False,,In Paradise to Adam or his race
, False,,Charged not to touch the interdicted tree
, False,,If they transgress and slight that sole command
, False,,So easily obeyed amid the choice
, False,,Of all tastes else to please their appetite
, False,,Though wandering He with his consorted Eve
, False,,The story heard attentive and was filled
, False,,With admiration and deep muse to hear
, False,,Of things so high and strange things to their thought
, False,,So unimaginable as hate in Heaven
, False,,And war so near the peace of God in bliss
, False,,With such confusion but the evil soon
, False,,Driven back redounded as a flood on those
, False,,From whom it sprung impossible to mix
, False,,With blessedness Whence Adam soon repealed
, False,,The doubts that in his heart arose and now
, False,,Led on yet sinless with desire to know
, False,,What nearer might concern him how this world
, False,,Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began
, False,,When and whereof created for what cause
, False,,What within Eden or without was done
, False,,Before his memory as one whose drought
, False,,Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream
, False,,Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites
, False,,Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest
, False,,Great things and full of wonder in our ears
, False,,Far differing from this world thou hast revealed
, False,,Divine interpreter by favor sent
, False,,Down from the empyrean to forewarn
, False,,Us timely of what might else have been our loss
, False,,Unknown which human knowledge could not reach
, False,,For which to the infinitely Good we owe
, False,,Immortal thanks and his admonishment
, False,,Receive with solemn purpose to observe
, False,,Immutably his sovereign will the end
, False,,Of what we are But since thou hast vouchsafed

, False,,But of the tree whose operation brings
, False,,Knowledge of good and ill which I have set
, False,,The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith

, False,,A Goddess among Gods adored and served
, False,,By angels numberless thy daily train
, False,,So glozed the Tempter and his proem tuned
, False,,Into the heart of Eve his words made way
, False,,Though at the voice much marveling at length
, False,,Not unamazed she thus in answer spake
, False,,What may this mean language of man pronounced
, False,,By tongue of brute and human sense expressed
, False,,The first at least of these I thought denied
, False,,To beasts whom God on their creationday
, False,,Created mute to all articulate sound

, False,,Much reason and in their actions oft appears
, False,,Thee Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
, False,,I knew but not with human voice endued
, False,,Redouble then this miracle and say
, False,,How camest thou speakable of mute and how
, False,,To me so friendly grown above the rest

, False,,Empress of this fair world resplendent Eve
, False,,Easy to me it is to tell thee all
, False,,What thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed
, False,,I was at first as other beasts that graze
, False,,The trodden herb of abject thoughts and low
, False,,As was my food nor aught but food discerned
, False,,Or sex and apprehended nothing high
, False,,Till on a day roving the field I chanced
, False,,A goodly tree far distant to behold
, False,,Loaden with fruit of fairest colors mixed
, False,,Ruddy and gold I nearer drew to gaze
, False,,When from the boughs a savory odor blown
, False,,Grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
, False,,Than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
, False,,Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even
, False,,Unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play
, False,,To satisfy the sharp desire I had
, False,,Of tasting those fair apples I resolved
, False,,Not to defer hunger and thirst at once
, False,,Powerful persuaders quickened at the scent

, False,,About the mossy trunk I wound me soon
, False,,For high from ground the branches would require
, False,,Thy utmost reach or Adams Round the tree
, False,,All other beasts that saw with like desire

, False,,But all that fair and good in thy divine
, False,,Semblance and in thy beautys heavenly ray

, False,,Yet more amazed unwary thus replied
, False,,Serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
, False,,The virtue of that fruit in thee first proved
, False,,But say where grows the tree from hence how far
, False,,For many are the trees of God that grow
, False,,In Paradise and various yet unknown
, False,,To us in such abundance lies our choice

, False,,Misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way
, False,,To bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool
, False,,There swallowed up and lost from succor far
, False,,So glistered the dire Snake and into fraud
, False,,Led Eve our credulous mother to the tree

, False,,Serpent we might have spared our coming hither
, False,,Fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
, False,,The credit of whose virtue rest with thee
, False,,Wondrous indeed if cause of such effects
, False,,But of this tree we may not taste nor touch

, False,,The Tempter but with show of zeal and love
, False,,To Man and indignation at his wrong
, False,,New part puts on and as to passion moved
, False,,Fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
, False,,Raised as of some great matter to begin
, False,,As when of old some orator renowned
, False,,In Athens or free Rome where eloquence
, False,,Flourished since mute to some great cause addressed
, False,,Stood in himself collected while each part
, False,,Motion each act won audience ere the tongue
, False,,Sometimes in heighth began as no delay
, False,,Of preface brooking through his zeal of right
, False,,So standing moving or to heighth up grown
, False,,The Tempter all impassioned thus began
, False,,Oh sacred wise and wisdomgiving Plant
, False,,Mother of science now I feel thy power
, False,,Within me clear not only to discern
, False,,Things in their causes but to trace the ways
, False,,Of highest agents deemed however wise
, False,,Queen of this universe do not believe
, False,,Those rigid threats of death ye shall not die
, False,,How should you by the fruit it gives you life
, False,,To knowledge by the threatener look on me
, False,,Me who have touched and tasted yet both live
, False,,And life more perfect have attained than Fate
, False,,Meant me by venturing higher than my lot
, False,,Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast
, False,,Is open or will God incense his ire
, False,,For such a petty trespass and not praise
, False,,Rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
, False,,Of death denounced whatever thing death be
, False,,Deterred not from achieving what might lead
, False,,To happier life knowledge of good and evil
, False,,Of good how just of evil if what is evil
, False,,Be real why not known since easier shunned
, False,,God therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
, False,,Not just not God not feared then nor obeyed
, False,,Your fear itself of death removes the fear
, False,,Why then was this forbid Why but to awe
, False,,Why but to keep ye low and ignorant
, False,,His worshippers He knows that in the day
, False,,Ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear
, False,,Yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
, False,,Opened and cleared and ye shall be as Gods
, False,,Knowing both good and evil as they know
, False,,That ye shall be as Gods since I as Man
, False,,Internal Man is but proportion meet
, False,,I of brute human ye of human Gods
, False,,So ye shall die perhaps by putting off
, False,,Human to put on Gods death to be wished
, False,,Though threatened which no worse than this can bring
, False,,And what are Gods that man may not become
, False,,As they participating Godlike food
, False,,The Gods are first and that advantage use
, False,,On our belief that all from them proceeds
, False,,I question it for this fair earth I see
, False,,Warmed by the sun producing every kind
, False,,Them nothing if they all things who enclosed
, False,,Knowledge of good and evil in this tree
, False,,That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
, False,,Wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
, False,,The offence that man should thus attain to know
, False,,What can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
, False,,Impart against his will if all be his
, False,,Or is it envy and can envy dwell
, False,,In heavenly breasts These these and many more
, False,,Causes import your need of this fair fruit
, False,,Goddess humane reach then and freely taste
, False,,He ended and his words replete with guile
, False,,Into her heart too easy entrance won
, False,,Fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
, False,,Might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
, False,,Yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
, False,,With reason to her seeming and with truth
, False,,Mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
, False,,An eager appetite raised by the smell
, False,,So savory of that fruit which with desire
, False,,Inclinable now grown to touch or taste
, False,,Solicited her longing eye yet first
, False,,Pausing a while thus to herself she mused
, False,,Great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits
, False,,Though kept from man and worthy to be admired
, False,,Whose taste too long forborne at first assay
, False,,Gave elocution to the mute and taught
, False,,The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise
, False,,Thy praise he also who forbids thy use
, False,,Conceals not from us naming thee the tree
, False,,Of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil
, False,,Forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
, False,,Commends thee more while it infers the good
, False,,By thee communicated and our want
, False,,For good unknown sure is not had or had
, False,,And yet unknown is as not had at all
, False,,In plain then what forbids he but to know
, False,,Forbids us good forbids us to be wise
, False,,Such prohibitions bind not But if death
, False,,Bind us with afterbands what profits then
, False,,Our inward freedom In the day we eat
, False,,Of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die
, False,,How dies the serpent he hath eaten and lives
, False,,And knows and speaks and reasons and discerns
, False,,Irrational till then For us alone
, False,,Was death invented or to us denied
, False,,This intellectual food for beasts reserved
, False,,For beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
, False,,Hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
, False,,The good befallen him author unsuspect
, False,,Friendly to man far from deceit or guile
, False,,What fear I then rather what know to fear
, False,,Under this ignorance of good and evil
, False,,Of God or death of law or penalty
, False,,Here grows the cure of all this fruit divine
, False,,Fair to the eye inviting to the taste
, False,,Of virtue to make wise What hinders then
, False,,To reach and feed at once both body and mind
, False,,So saying her rash hand in evil hour
, False,,Forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she ate
, False,,Earth felt the wound and nature from her seat
, False,,Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe
, False,,That all was lost Back to the thicket slunk
, False,,The guilty serpent and well might for Eve
, False,,Intent now wholly on her taste naught else
, False,,Regarded such delight till then as seemed
, False,,In fruit she never tasted whether true
, False,,Or fancied so through expectation high
, False,,Of knowledge not was Godhead from her thought
, False,,Greedily she ingorged without restraint
, False,,And knew not eating death Satiate at length
, False,,And heightened as with wine jocund and boon
, False,,Thus to herself she pleasingly began
, False,,Oh sovereign virtuous precious of all trees
, False,,In Paradise of operation blest
, False,,To sapience hitherto obscured infamed
, False,,And thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
, False,,Created but henceforth my early care
, False,,Not without song each morning and due praise
, False,,Shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease
, False,,Of thy full branches offered free to all
, False,,Till dieted by thee I grow mature
, False,,In knowledge as the Gods who all things know
, False,,Though others envy what they cannot give
, False,,For had the gift been theirs it had not here
, False,,Thus grown Experience next to thee I owe
, False,,Best guide not following thee I had remained
, False,,In ignorance thou openest wisdoms way
, False,,And givest access though secret she retire
, False,,And I perhaps am secret Heaven is high
, False,,High and remote to see from thence distinct
, False,,Each thing on Earth and other care perhaps
, False,,May have diverted from continual watch
, False,,Our great Forbidder safe with all his spies
, False,,About him But to Adam in what sort
, False,,Shall I appear shall I to him make known
, False,,As yet my change and give him to partake
, False,,Full happiness with me or rather not
, False,,But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
, False,,Without copartner so to add what wants
, False,,In female sex the more to draw his love
, False,,And render me more equal and perhaps
, False,,A thing not undesirable sometime
, False,,Superior for inferior who is free
, False,,This may be well But what if God have seen
, False,,And death ensue then I shall be no more
, False,,And Adam wedded to another Eve
, False,,Shall live with her enjoying I extinct
, False,,A death to think Confirmed then I resolve
, False,,Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe
, False,,So dear I love him that with him all deaths
, False,,I could endure without him live no life
, False,,So saying from the tree her step she turned
, False,,But first low reverence done as to the Power
, False,,That dwelt within whose presence had infused
, False,,Into the plant sciential sap derived
, False,,From nectar drink of Gods Adam the while
, False,,Waiting desirous her return had wove
, False,,Of choicest flowers a garland to adorn
, False,,Her tresses and her rural labors crown
, False,,As reapers oft are wont their harvestqueen
, False,,Great joy he promised to his thoughts and new
, False,,Solace in her return so long delayed
, False,,Yet oft his heart divine of something ill
, False,,Misgave him he the faltering measure felt
, False,,And forth to meet her went the way she took
, False,,That morn when first they parted by the tree
, False,,Of knowledge he must pass there he her met
, False,,Scarce from the tree returning in her hand
, False,,A bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled
, False,,New gathered and ambrosial smell diffused
, False,,To him she hasted in her face excuse
, False,,Came prologue and apology too prompt
, False,,Which with bland words at will she thus addressed
, False,,Hast thou not wondered Adam at my stay
, False,,Thee I have missed and thought it long deprived
, False,,Thy presence agony of love till now
, False,,Not felt nor shall be twice for never more
, False,,Mean I to try what rash untried I sought
, False,,The pain of absence from thy sight But strange
, False,,Hath been the cause and wonderful to hear
, False,,This tree is not as we are told a tree
, False,,Of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
, False,,Opening the way but of divine effect
, False,,To open eyes and make them Gods who taste
, False,,And hath been tasted such The serpent wise
, False,,Or not restrained as we or not obeying
, False,,Hath eaten of the fruit and is become
, False,,Not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth
, False,,Endued with human voice and human sense
, False,,Reasoning to admiration and with me
, False,,Persuasively hath so prevailed that I
, False,,Have also tasted and have also found
, False,,The effects to correspond opener mine eyes
, False,,Dim erst dilated spirits ampler heart
, False,,And growing up to Godhead which for thee
, False,,Chiefly I sought without thee can despise
, False,,For bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss
, False,,Tedious unshared with thee and odious soon
, False,,Thou therefore also taste that equal lot
, False,,May join us equal joy as equal love
, False,,Lest thou not tasting different degree
, False,,Disjoin us and I then too late renounce
, False,,Deity for thee when Fate will not permit
, False,,Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told
, False,,But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed
, False,,On the other side Adam soon as he heard
, False,,The fatal trespass done by Eve amazed
, False,,Astonied stood and blank while horror chill
, False,,Ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed
, False,,From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve
, False,,Down dropt and all the faded roses shed
, False,,Speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
, False,,First to himself he inward silence broke
, False,,Oh fairest of creation last and best
, False,,Of all Gods works Creature in whom excelled
, False,,Whatever can to sight or thought be formed
, False,,Holy divine good amiable or sweet
, False,,How art thou lost how on a sudden lost
, False,,Defaced deflowered and now to death devote
, False,,Rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
, False,,The strict forbiddance how to violate
, False,,The sacred fruit forbidden Some cursed fraud
, False,,Of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown
, False,,And me with thee hath ruined for with thee
, False,,Certain my resolution is to die
, False,,How can I live without thee how forego
, False,,Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined
, False,,To live again in these wild woods forlorn
, False,,Should God create another Eve and I
, False,,Another rib afford yet loss of thee
, False,,Would never from my heart No no I feel
, False,,The link of nature draw me flesh of flesh
, False,,Bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
, False,,Mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
, False,,So having said as one from sad dismay
, False,,Recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
, False,,Submitting to what seemed remediless
, False,,Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned
, False,,Bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous Eve
, False,,And peril great provoked who thus hast dared
, False,,Had it been only coveting to eye
, False,,That sacred fruit sacred to abstinence
, False,,Much more to taste it under ban to touch
, False,,But past who can recall or done undo
, False,,Not God Omnipotent nor Fate yet so
, False,,Perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
, False,,Is not so heinous now foretasted fruit
, False,,Profaned first by the serpent by him first
, False,,Made common and unhallowed ere our taste
, False,,Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
, False,,Lives as thou saidst and gains to live as Man
, False,,Higher degree of life inducement strong
, False,,To us as likely tasting to attain
, False,,Proportional ascent which cannot be
, False,,But to be gods or angels demigods
, False,,Nor can I think that God Creator wise
, False,,Though threatening will in earnest so destroy
, False,,Us his prime creatures dignified so high
, False,,Set over all his works which in our fall
, False,,For us created needs with us must fail
, False,,Dependant made so God shall uncreate
, False,,Be frustrate do undo and labor lose
, False,,Not well conceived of God who though his power
, False,,Creation could repeat yet would be loath
, False,,Us to abolish lest the Adversary
, False,,Triumph and say Fickle their state whom God
, False,,Most favors who can please him long Me first
, False,,He ruined now Mankind whom will he next
, False,,Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe
, False,,However I with thee have fixed my lot
, False,,Certain to undergo like doom If death
, False,,Consort with thee death is to me as life
, False,,So forcible within my heart I feel
, False,,The bond of Nature draw me to my own
, False,,My own in thee for what thou art is mine
, False,,Our state cannot be severed we are one
, False,,One flesh to lose thee were to lose myself
, False,,So Adam and thus Eve to him replied
, False,,Oh glorious trial of exceeding love
, False,,Illustrious evidence example high
, False,,Engaging me to emulate but short
, False,,Of thy perfection how shall I attain
, False,,Adam from whose dear side I boast me sprung
, False,,And gladly of our union hear thee speak
, False,,One heart one soul in both whereof good proof
, False,,This day affords declaring thee resolved
, False,,Rather than death or aught than death more dread
, False,,Shall separate us linked in love so dear
, False,,To undergo with me one guilt one crime
, False,,If any be of tasting this fair fruit
, False,,Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds
, False,,Direct or by occasion hath presented
, False,,This happy trial of thy love which else
, False,,So eminently never had been known
, False,,Were it I thought death menaced would ensue
, False,,This my attempt I would sustain alone
, False,,The worst and not persuade thee rather die
, False,,Deserted than oblige thee with a fact
, False,,Pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
, False,,Remarkably so late of thy so true
, False,,So faithful love unequalled but I feel
, False,,Far otherwise the event not death but life
, False,,Augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys
, False,,Taste so divine that what of sweet before
, False,,Hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh
, False,,On my experience Adam freely taste
, False,,And fear of death deliver to the winds
, False,,So saying she embraced him and for joy
, False,,Tenderly wept much won that he his love
, False,,Had so ennobled as of choice to incur
, False,,Divine displeasure for her sake or death
, False,,In recompense for such compliance bad
, False,,Such recompense best merits from the bough
, False,,She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
, False,,With liberal hand he scrupled not to eat
, False,,Against his better knowledge not deceived
, False,,But fondly overcome with female charm
, False,,Earth trembled from her entrails as again
, False,,In pangs and Nature gave a second groan
, False,,Sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops
, False,,Wept at completing of the mortal sin
, False,,Original while Adam took no thought
, False,,Eating his fill nor Eve to iterate
, False,,Her former trespass feared the more to sooth
, False,,Him with her loved society that now
, False,,As with new wine intocated both
, False,,They swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
, False,,Divinity within them breeding wings
, False,,Wherewith to scorn the earth But that false fruit
, False,,Far other operation first displayed
, False,,Carnal desire inflaming he on Eve
, False,,Began to cast lascivious eyes she him
, False,,As wantonly repaid in lust they burn
, False,,Till Adam thus gan Eve to dalliance move
, False,,Eve now I see thou art exact of taste
, False,,And elegant of sapience no small part
, False,,Since to each meaning savor we apply
, False,,And palate call judicious I the praise
, False,,Yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed
, False,,Much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
, False,,From this delightful fruit nor known till now
, False,,True relish tasting if such pleasure be
, False,,In things to us forbidden it might be wished
, False,,For this one tree had been forbidden ten
, False,,But come so well refreshed now let us play
, False,,As meet is after such delicious fare
, False,,For never did thy beauty since the day
, False,,I saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
, False,,With all perfections so inflame my sense
, False,,With ardor to enjoy thee fairer now
, False,,Than ever bounty of this virtuous tree
, False,,So said he and forbore not glance or toy
, False,,Of amorous intent well understood
, False,,Of Eve whose eye darted contagious fire
, False,,Her hand he seized and to a shady bank
, False,,Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered
, False,,He led her nothing loath flowers were the couch
, False,,Pansies and violets and asphodel
, False,,And hyacinth Earths freshest softest lap
, False,,There they their fill of love and loves disport
, False,,Took largely of their mutual guilt the seal
, False,,The solace of their sin till dewy sleep
, False,,Oppressed them wearied with their amorous play
, False,,Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit
, False,,That with exhilarating vapor bland
, False,,About their spirits had played and inmost powers
, False,,Made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep
, False,,Bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
, False,,Incumbered now had left them up they rose
, False,,As from unrest and each the other viewing
, False,,Soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
, False,,How darkened innocence that as a veil
, False,,Had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone
, False,,Just confidence and native righteousness
, False,,And honor from about them naked left
, False,,To guilty Shame he covered but his robe
, False,,Uncovered more So rose the Danite strong
, False,,Herculean Samson from the harlotlap
, False,,Of Philistine Delilah and waked
, False,,Shorn of his strength They destitute and bare
, False,,Of all their virtue Silent and in face
, False,,Confounded long they sat as strucken mute
, False,,Till Adam though not less than Eve abashed
, False,,At length gave utterance to these words constrained
, False,,Oh Eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
, False,,To that false worm of whomsoever taught
, False,,To counterfeit Mans voice true in our fall
, False,,False in our promised rising since our eyes
, False,,Opened we find indeed and find we know
, False,,Both good and evil good lost and evil got
, False,,Bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know
, False,,Which leaves us naked thus of honor void
, False,,Of innocence of faith of purity
, False,,Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained
, False,,And in our faces evident the signs
, False,,Of foul concupiscence whence evil store
, False,,Even shame the last of evils of the first
, False,,Be sure then How shall I behold the face
, False,,Henceforth of God or angel erst with joy
, False,,And rapture so oft beheld Those heavenly shapes
, False,,Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
, False,,Insufferably bright Oh might I here
, False,,In solitude live savage in some glade
, False,,Obscured where highest woods impenetrable
, False,,To star or sunlight spread their umbrage broad
, False,,And brown as evening Cover me ye Pines
, False,,Ye Cedars with innumerable boughs
, False,,Hide me where I may never see them more
, False,,But let us now as in bad plight devise
, False,,What best may for the present serve to hide
, False,,The parts of each from other that seem most
, False,,To shame obnoous and unseemliest seen
, False,,Some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed
, False,,And girded on our loins may cover round
, False,,Those middle parts that this new comer Shame
, False,,There sit not and reproach us as unclean
, False,,So counseled he and both together went
, False,,Into the thickest wood there soon they chose
, False,,The figtree not that kind for fruit renowned
, False,,But such as at this day to Indians known
, False,,In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
, False,,Branching so broad and long that in the ground
, False,,The bended twigs take root and daughters grow
, False,,About the mother tree a pillared shade
, False,,High overarched and echoing walks between
, False,,There oft the Indian herdsman shunning heat
, False,,Shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds
, False,,At loopholes cut through thickest shade Those leaves
, False,,They gathered broad as Amazonian targe
, False,,And with what skill they had together sewed
, False,,To gird their waist vain covering if to hide
, False,,Their guilt and dreaded shame Oh how unlike
, False,,To that first naked glory Such of late
, False,,Columbus found the American so girt
, False,,With feathered cincture naked else and wild
, False,,Among the trees on isles and woody shores
, False,,Thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part
, False,,Covered but not at rest or ease of mind
, False,,They sat them down to weep nor only tears
, False,,Rained at their eyes but high winds worse within
, False,,Began to rise high passions anger hate
, False,,Mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
, False,,Their inward state of mind calm region once
, False,,And full of peace now tossed and turbulent
, False,,For Understanding ruled not and the Will
, False,,Heard not her lore both in subjection now
, False,,To sensual Appetite who from beneath
, False,,Usurping over sovereign Reason claimed
, False,,Superior sway From thus distempered breast
, False,,Adam estranged in look and altered style
, False,,Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed
, False,,Would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid
, False,,With me as I besought thee when that strange
, False,,Desire of wandering this unhappy morn
, False,,I know not whence possessed thee we had then
, False,,Remained still happy not as now despoiled
, False,,Of all our good shamed naked miserable
, False,,Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
, False,,The faith they owe when earnestly they seek
, False,,Such proof conclude they then begin to fail
, False,,To whom soon moved with touch of blame thus Eve
, False,,What words have passed thy lips Adam severe
, False,,Imputest thou that to my default or will
, False,,Of wandering as thou callest it which who knows
, False,,But might as ill have happened thou being by
, False,,Or to thyself perhaps Hadst thou been there
, False,,Or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned
, False,,Fraud in the Serpent speaking as he spake
, False,,No ground of enmity between us known
, False,,Why he should mean me ill or seek to harm
, False,,Was I to have never parted from thy side
, False,,As good have grown there still a lifeless rib
, False,,Being as I am why didst not thou the head
, False,,Command me absolutely not to go
, False,,Going into such danger as thou saidst
, False,,Too facile then thou didst not much gainsay
, False,,Nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss
, False,,Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent
, False,,Neither had I transgressed nor thou with me
, False,,To whom then first incensed Adam replied
, False,,Is this the love is this the recompense
, False,,Of mine to thee ingrateful Eve expressed
, False,,Immutable when thou wert lost not I
, False,,Who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss
, False,,Yet willingly chose rather death with thee
, False,,And am I now upbraided as the cause
, False,,Of thy transgressing Not enough severe
, False,,It seems in thy restraint What could I more
, False,,I warned thee I admonished thee foretold
, False,,The danger and the lurking enemy
, False,,That lay in wait beyond this had been force
, False,,And force upon free will hath here no place
, False,,But confidence then bore thee on secure
, False,,Either to meet no danger or to find
, False,,Matter of glorious trial and perhaps
, False,,I also erred in overmuch admiring
, False,,What seemed in thee so perfect that I thought
, False,,No evil durst attempt thee but I rue
, False,,The error now which is become my crime
, False,,And thou the accuser Thus it shall befall
, False,,Him who to worth in women overtrusting
, False,,Lets her will rule restraint she will not brook
, False,,And left to herself if evil thence ensue
, False,,She first his weak indulgence will accuse
, False,,Thus they in mutual accusation spent
, False,,The fruitless hours but neither selfcondemning
, False,,And of their vain contest appeared no end
, False,,Meanwhile the heinous and despiteful act
, False,,Of Satan done in Paradise and how
, False,,He in the serpent had perverted Eve
, False,,Her husband she to taste the fatal fruit
, False,,Was known in Heaven for what can scape the eye
, False,,Of God allseeing or deceive his heart
, False,,Omniscient who in all things wise and just

, False,,Whoever tempted which they not obeying
, False,,Incurred what could they less the penalty
, False,,And manifold in sin deserved to fall
, False,,Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste
, False,,The angelic guards ascended mute and sad
, False,,For Man for of his state by this they knew
, False,,Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen
, False,,Entrance unseen Soon as the unwelcome news
, False,,From Earth arrived at Heavengate displeased
, False,,All were who heard dim sadness did not spare
, False,,That time celestial visages yet mixed
, False,,With pity violated not their bliss
, False,,About the newarrived in multitudes
, False,,The ethereal people ran to hear and know
, False,,How all befell They towards the throne supreme
, False,,Accountable made haste to make appear
, False,,With righteous plea their utmost vigilance
, False,,And easily approved when the Most High
, False,,Eternal Father from his secret cloud
, False,,Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice
, False,,Assembled angels and ye Powers returned
, False,,From unsuccessful charge be not dismayed
, False,,Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth
, False,,Which your sincerest care could not prevent
, False,,Foretold so lately what would come to pass
, False,,When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell
, False,,I told ye then he should prevail and speed
, False,,On his bad errand man should be seduced
, False,,And flattered out of all believing lies
, False,,Against his Maker no decree of mine
, False,,Concurring to necessitate his fall
, False,,Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
, False,,His free will to her own inclining left
, False,,In even scale But fallen he is and now
, False,,What rests but that the mortal sentence pass
, False,,On his transgression death denounced that day
, False,,Which he presumes already vain and void
, False,,Because not yet inflicted as he feared
, False,,By some immediate stroke but soon shall find
, False,,Forbearance no acquittance ere day end
, False,,Justice shall not return as bounty scorned
, False,,But whom send I to judge them whom but thee
, False,,Vicegerent Son To thee I have transferred
, False,,All judgment whether in Heaven or Earth or Hell
, False,,Easy it may be seen that I intend
, False,,Mercy colleague with justice sending thee
, False,,Mans friend his Mediator his designed
, False,,Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary
, False,,And destined man himself to judge man fallen
, False,,So spake the Father and unfolding bright
, False,,Toward the right hand his glory on the Son
, False,,Blazed forth unclouded Deity He full
, False,,Resplendent all his Father manifest
, False,,Expressed and thus divinely answered mild
, False,,Father Eternal thine is to decree
, False,,Mine both in Heaven and Earth to do thy will
, False,,Supreme that thou in me thy Son beloved
, False,,Mayest ever rest well pleased I go to judge
, False,,On earth these thy transgressors but thou knowest
, False,,Whoever judged the worst on me must light
, False,,When time shall be for so I undertook
, False,,Before thee and not repenting this obtain
, False,,Of right that I may mitigate their doom
, False,,On me derived yet I shall temper so
, False,,Justice with mercy as may illustrate most
, False,,Them fully satisfied and thee appease
, False,,Attendance none shall need nor train where none
, False,,Are to behold the judgment but the judged
, False,,Those two the third best absent is condemned
, False,,Convict by flight and rebel to all law
, False,,Conviction to the serpent none belongs
, False,,Thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
, False,,Of high collateral glory Him Thrones and Powers
, False,,Princedoms and Dominations ministrant
, False,,Accompanied to Heavengate from whence
, False,,Eden and all the coast in prospect lay
, False,,Down he descended straight the speed of Gods
, False,,Time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged
, False,,Now was the sun in western cadence low
, False,,From noon and gentle airs due at their hour
, False,,To fan the earth now waked and usher in
, False,,The evening cool when he from wrath more cool
, False,,Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both
, False,,To sentence Man The voice of God they heard
, False,,Now walking in the garden by soft winds
, False,,Brought to their ears while day declined they heard
, False,,And from his presence hid themselves among
, False,,The thickest trees both man and wife till God
, False,,Approaching thus to Adam called aloud
, False,,Where art thou Adam wont with joy to meet
, False,,My coming seen far off I miss thee here
, False,,Not pleased thus entertained with solitude
, False,,Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought
, False,,Or come I less conspicuous or what change
, False,,Absents thee or what chance detains Come forth
, False,,He came and with him Eve more loath though first
, False,,To offend discountenanced both and discomposed
, False,,Love was not in their looks either to God
, False,,Or to each other but apparent guilt
, False,,And shame and perturbation and despair
, False,,Anger and obstinacy and hate and guile
, False,,Whence Adam faltering long thus answered brief
, False,,I heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
, False,,Afraid being naked hid myself To whom
, False,,The gracious Judge without revile replied
, False,,My voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared
, False,,But still rejoiced how is it now become
, False,,So dreadful to thee That thou art naked who
, False,,Hath told thee Hast thou eaten of the tree
, False,,Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat
, False,,To whom thus Adam sore beset replied
, False,,Oh Heaven in evil strait this day I stand
, False,,Before my Judge either to undergo
, False,,Myself the total crime or to accuse
, False,,My other self the partner of my life
, False,,Whose failing while her faith to me remains
, False,,I should conceal and not expose to blame
, False,,By my complaint but strict necessity
, False,,Subdues me and calamitous constraint
, False,,Lest on my head both sin and punishment
, False,,However insupportable be all
, False,,Devolved though should I hold my peace yet thou
, False,,Wouldst easily detect what I conceal
, False,,This Woman whom thou madest to be my help
, False,,And gavest me as thy perfect gift so good
, False,,So fit so acceptable so divine
, False,,That from her hand I could suspect no ill
, False,,And what she did whatever in itself
, False,,Her doing seemed to justify the deed
, False,,She gave me of the tree and I did eat
, False,,To whom the Sovereign Presence thus replied
, False,,Was she thy God that her thou didst obey
, False,,Before his voice or was she made thy guide
, False,,Superior or but equal that to her
, False,,Thou didst resign thy manhood and the place
, False,,Wherein God set thee above her made of thee
, False,,And for thee whose perfection far excelled
, False,,Hers in all real dignity Adorned
, False,,She was indeed and lovely to attract
, False,,Thy love not thy subjection and her gifts
, False,,Were such as under government well seemed
, False,,Unseemly to bear rule which was thy part
, False,,And person hadst thou known thyself aright
, False,,So having said he thus to Eve in few
, False,,Say Woman what is this which thou hast done
, False,,To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelmed
, False,,Confessing soon yet not before her Judge
, False,,Bold or loquacious thus abashed replied
, False,,The serpent me beguiled and I did eat
, False,,Which when the Lord God heard without delay
, False,,To judgment he proceeded on the accused
, False,,Serpent though brute unable to transfer
, False,,The guilt on him who made him instrument
, False,,Of mischief and polluted from the end
, False,,Of his creation justly then accursed
, False,,As vitiated in nature More to know
, False,,Concerned not Man since he no further knew
, False,,Nor altered his offence yet God at last
, False,,To Satan first in sin his doom applied
, False,,Though in mysterious terms judged as then best
, False,,And on the serpent thus his curse let fall
, False,,Because thou hast done this thou art accursed
, False,,Above all cattle each beast of the field
, False,,Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go
, False,,And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life
, False,,Between thee and the woman I will put
, False,,Enmity and between thine and her seed
, False,,Her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel
, False,,So spake this oracle then verified
, False,,When Jesus Son of Mary second Eve
, False,,Saw Satan fall like lightning down from Heaven
, False,,Prince of the air then rising from his grave
, False,,Spoiled Principalities and Powers triumphed
, False,,In open show and with ascension bright
, False,,Captivity led captive through the air
, False,,The realm itself of Satan long usurped
, False,,Whom he shall tread at last under our feet
, False,,Even he who now foretold his fatal bruise
, False,,And to the Woman thus his sentence turned
, False,,Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply
, False,,By thy conception children thou shalt bring
, False,,In sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
, False,,Thine shall submit he over thee shall rule
, False,,On Adam last thus judgment he pronounced
, False,,Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife
, False,,And eaten of the tree concerning which
, False,,I charged thee saying Thou shalt not eat thereof
, False,,Cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
, False,,Shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life
, False,,Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
, False,,Unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
, False,,In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
, False,,Till thou return unto the ground for thou
, False,,Out of the ground wast taken know thy birth
, False,,For dust thou art and shalt to dust return
, False,,So judged he man both Judge and Savior sent
, False,,And the instant stroke of death denounced that day
, False,,Removed far off then pitying how they stood
, False,,Before him naked to the air that now
, False,,Must suffer change disdained not to begin
, False,,Thenceforth the form of servant to assume
, False,,As when he washed his servants feet so now
, False,,As father of his family he clad
, False,,Their nakedness with skins of beasts or slain
, False,,Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid
, False,,And thought not much to clothe his enemies
, False,,Nor he their outward only with the skins
, False,,Of beasts but inward nakedness much more
, False,,Opprobrious with his robe of righteousness
, False,,Arraying covered from his Fathers sight
, False,,To him with swift ascent he up returned
, False,,Into his blissful bosom reassumed
, False,,In glory as of old to him appeased
, False,,All though allknowing what had passed with man
, False,,Recounted ming intercession sweet
, False,,Mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth
, False,,Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death
, False,,In counterview within the gates that now
, False,,Stood open wide belching outrageous flame
, False,,Far into chaos since the fiend passed through
, False,,Sin opening who thus now to Death began
, False,,Oh Son why sit we here each other viewing
, False,,Idly while Satan our great author thrives
, False,,In other worlds and happier seat provides
, False,,For us his offspring dear It cannot be
, False,,But that success attends him if mishap
, False,,Ere this he had returned with fury driven
, False,,By his avengers since no place like this
, False,,Can fit his punishment or their revenge
, False,,Methinks I feel new strength within me rise
, False,,Wings growing and dominion given me large
, False,,Beyond this deep whatever draws me on
, False,,Or sympathy or some connatural force
, False,,Powerful at greatest distance to unite
, False,,With secret amity things of like kind
, False,,By secretest conveyance Thou my shade
, False,,Inseparable must with me along
, False,,For Death from Sin no power can separate
, False,,But lest the difficulty of passing back
, False,,Stay his return perhaps over this gulf
, False,,Impassable impervious let us try
, False,,Adventurous work yet to thy power and mine
, False,,Not unagreeable to found a path
, False,,Over this main from Hell to that new world
, False,,Where Satan now prevails a monument
, False,,Of merit high to all the infernal host
, False,,Easing their passage hence for intercourse
, False,,Or transmigration as their lot shall lead
, False,,Nor can I miss the way so strongly drawn
, False,,By this newfelt attraction and instinct
, False,,Whom thus the meager shadow answered soon
, False,,Go whither fate and inclination strong
, False,,Leads thee I shall not lag behind nor err
, False,,The way thou leading such a scent I draw
, False,,Of carnage prey innumerable and taste
, False,,The savor of death from all things there that live
, False,,Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
, False,,Be wanting but afford thee equal aid
, False,,So saying with delight he snuffed the smell
, False,,Of mortal change on earth As when a flock
, False,,Of ravenous fowl though many a league remote
, False,,Against the day of battle to a field
, False,,Where armies lie encamped come flying lured
, False,,With scent of living carcasses designed
, False,,For death the following day in bloody fight
, False,,So scented the grim Feature and upturned
, False,,His nostril wide into the murky air
, False,,Sagacious of his quarry from so far
, False,,Then both from out Hellgates into the waste
, False,,Wide anarchy of Chaos damp and dark
, False,,Flew diverse and with power their power was great
, False,,Hovering upon the waters what they met
, False,,Solid or slimy as in raging sea
, False,,Tossed up and down together crowded drove
, False,,From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell
, False,,As when two polar winds blowing adverse
, False,,Upon the Cronian sea together drive
, False,,Mountains of ice that stop the imagined way
, False,,Beyond Petsora eastward to the rich
, False,,Cathaian coast The aggregated soil
, False,,Death with his mace petrific cold and dry
, False,,As with a trident smote and fixed as firm
, False,,As Delos floating once the rest his look
, False,,Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move
, False,,And with asphaltic slime broad as the gate
, False,,Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach
, False,,They fastened and the mole immense wrought on
, False,,Over the foaming deep higharched a bridge
, False,,Of length prodigious joining to the wall
, False,,Immoveable of this now fenceless world
, False,,Forfeit to Death from hence a passage broad
, False,,Smooth easy inoffensive down to Hell
, False,,So if great things to small may be compared
, False,,Xerxes the liberty of Greece to yoke
, False,,From Susa his Memnonian palace high
, False,,Came to the sea and over Hellespont
, False,,Bridging his way Europe with Asia joined
, False,,And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves
, False,,Now had they brought the work by wondrous art
, False,,Pontifical a ridge of pendant rock
, False,,Over the vexed abyss following the track
, False,,Of Satan to the selfsame place where he
, False,,First lighted from his wing and landed safe
, False,,From out of Chaos to the outside bare
, False,,Of this round world With pins of adamant
, False,,And chains they made all fast too fast they made
, False,,And durable And now in little space
, False,,The confines met of empyrean Heaven
, False,,And of this World and on the left hand Hell
, False,,With long reach interposed three several ways
, False,,In sight to each of these three places led
, False,,And now their way to Earth they had descried
, False,,To Paradise first tending when behold
, False,,Satan in likeness of an angel bright
, False,,Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
, False,,His zenith while the sun in Aries rose
, False,,Disguised he came but those his children dear
, False,,Their parent soon discerned though in disguise
, False,,He after Eve seduced unminded slunk
, False,,Into the wood fast by and changing shape
, False,,To observe the sequel saw his guileful act
, False,,By Eve though all unweeting seconded
, False,,Upon her husband saw their shame that sought
, False,,Vain covertures but when he saw descend
, False,,The Son of God to judge them terrified
, False,,He fled not hoping to escape but shun
, False,,The present fearing guilty what his wrath
, False,,Might suddenly inflict that past returned
, False,,By night and listening where the hapless pair
, False,,Sat in their sad discourse and various plaint
, False,,Thence gathered his own doom which understood
, False,,Not instant but of future time with joy
, False,,And tidings fraught to Hell he now returned
, False,,And at the brink of chaos near the foot
, False,,Of this new wondrous pontifice unhoped
, False,,Met who to meet him came his offspring dear
, False,,Great joy was at their meeting and at sight
, False,,Of that stupendous bridge his joy increased
, False,,Long he admiring stood till Sin his fair
, False,,Enchanting daughter thus the silence broke
, False,,Oh parent these are thy magnific deeds
, False,,Thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own
, False,,Thou art their author and prime architect
, False,,For I no sooner in my heart divined
, False,,My heart which by a secret harmony
, False,,Still moves with thine joined in connection sweet
, False,,That thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
, False,,Now also evidence but straight I felt
, False,,Though distant from thee worlds between yet felt
, False,,That I must after thee with this thy son
, False,,Such fatal consequence unites us three
, False,,Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds
, False,,Nor this unvoyagable gulf obscure
, False,,Detain from following thy illustrious track
, False,,Thou hast achieved our liberty confined
, False,,Within Hellgates till now thou us impowered
, False,,To fortify thus far and overlay
, False,,With this portentous bridge the dark abyss
, False,,Thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
, False,,What thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
, False,,With odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
, False,,Our foil in Heaven here thou shalt monarch reign
, False,,There didst not there let him still victor sway
, False,,As battle hath adjudged from this new world
, False,,Retiring by his own doom alienated
, False,,And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
, False,,Of all things parted by the empyreal bounds
, False,,His quadrature from thy orbicular world
, False,,Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne
, False,,Whom thus the prince of darkness answered glad
, False,,Fair daughter and thou son and grandchild both
, False,,High proof ye now have given to be the race
, False,,Of Satan for I glory in the name
, False,,Antagonist of Heavens Almighty King
, False,,Amply have merited of me of all
, False,,The infernal empire that so near Heavens door
, False,,Triumphal with triumphal act have met
, False,,Mine with this glorious work and made one realm
, False,,Hell and this world one realm one continent
, False,,Of easy thoroughfare Therefore while I
, False,,Descend through darkness on your road with ease
, False,,To my associate powers them to acquaint
, False,,With these successes and with them rejoice
, False,,You two this way among these numerous orbs
, False,,All yours right down to Paradise descend
, False,,There dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth
, False,,Dominion exercise and in the air
, False,,Chiefly on man sole lord of all declared
, False,,Him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill
, False,,My substitutes I send ye and create
, False,,Plenipotent on earth of matchless might
, False,,Issuing from me on your joint vigor now
, False,,My hold of this new kingdom all depends
, False,,Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit
, False,,If your joint power prevail the affairs of Hell
, False,,No detriment need fear go and be strong
, False,,So saying he dismissed them they with speed
, False,,Their course through thickest constellations held
, False,,Spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan
, False,,And planets planetstruck real eclipse
, False,,Then suffered The other way Satan went down
, False,,The causey to Hellgate On either side
, False,,Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed
, False,,And with rebounding surge the bars assailed
, False,,That scorned his indignation Through the gate
, False,,Wide open and unguarded Satan passed
, False,,And all about found desolate for those
, False,,Appointed to sit there had left their charge
, False,,Flown to the upper world the rest were all
, False,,Far to the inland retired about the walls
, False,,Of Pandemonium city and proud seat
, False,,Of Lucifer so by allusion called
, False,,Of that bright star to Satan paragoned
, False,,There kept their watch the legions while the Grand
, False,,In council sat solicitous what chance
, False,,Might intercept their emperor sent so he
, False,,Departing gave command and they observed
, False,,As when the Tartar from his Russian foe
, False,,By Astracan over the snowy plains
, False,,Retires or Bactrin Sophi from the horns
, False,,Of Turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
, False,,The realm of Aladule in his retreat
, False,,To Taurus or Casbeen So these the late
, False,,Heavenbanished host left desert utmost Hell
, False,,Many a dark league reduced in careful watch
, False,,Round their metropolis and now expecting
, False,,Each hour their great adventurer from the search
, False,,Of foreign worlds He through the midst unmarked
, False,,In show plebeian angel militant
, False,,Of lowest order passed and from the door
, False,,Of that Plutonian hall invisible
, False,,Ascended his high throne which under state
, False,,Of richest texture spread at the upper end
, False,,Was placed in regal luster Down a while
, False,,He sat and round about him saw unseen
, False,,At last as from a cloud his fulgent head
, False,,And shape starbright appeared or brighter clad
, False,,With what permissive glory since his fall
, False,,Was left him or false glitter All amazed
, False,,At that so sudden blaze the stygian throng
, False,,Bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld
, False,,Their mighty chief returned loud was the acclaim
, False,,Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers
, False,,Raised from their dark divan and with like joy

, False,,What I have done what suffered with what pain
, False,,Voyaged the unreal vast unbounded deep
, False,,Of horrible confusion over which
, False,,By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved
, False,,To expedite your glorious march but I
, False,,Toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
, False,,The untractable abyss plunged in the womb
, False,,Of unoriginal night and chaos wild
, False,,That jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
, False,,My journey strange with clamorous uproar
, False,,Protesting fate supreme thence how I found
, False,,The new created world which fame in Heaven
, False,,Long had foretold a fabric wonderful
, False,,Of absolute perfection Therein man
, False,,Placed in a Paradise by our ele

, False,,According to his doom he would have spoke
, False,,But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
, False,,To forked tongue for now were all transformed
, False,,Alike to serpents all as accessories

, False,,Strange contradiction which to God himself
, False,,Impossible is held as argument
, False,,Of weakness not of power Will he draw out
, False,,For angers sake finite to infinite
, False,,In punished Man to satisfy his rigor
, False,,Satisfied never That were to extend
, False,,His sentence beyond dust and Natures law
, False,,By which all causes else according still
, False,,To the reception of their matter act
, False,,Not to the extent of their own sphere But say
, False,,That death be not one stroke as I supposed
, False,,Bereaving sense but endless misery
, False,,From this day onward which I feel begun
, False,,Both in me and without me and so last
, False,,To perpetuity Ay me that fear
, False,,Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
, False,,On my defenseless head both Death and I
, False,,Am found eternal and incorporate both
, False,,Nor I on my part single in me all
, False,,Posterity stands cursed Fair patrimony
, False,,That I must leave ye Sons Oh were I able
, False,,To waste it all myself and leave ye none
, False,,So disinherited how would you bless
, False,,Me now your curse Ah why should all mankind
, False,,For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned
, False,,It guiltless But from me what can proceed
, False,,But all corrupt both mind and will depraved
, False,,Not to do only but to will the same
, False,,With me How can they then acquitted stand
, False,,In sight of God Him after all disputes
, False,,Forced I absolve all my evasions vain
, False,,And reasonings though through mazes lead me still
, False,,But to my own conviction first and last
, False,,On me me only as the source and spring
, False,,Of all corruption all the blame lights due
, False,,So might the wrath Fond wish Couldst thou support
, False,,That burden heavier than the earth to bear
, False,,Than all the world much heavier though divided
, False,,With that bad woman Thus what thou desirest
, False,,And what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
, False,,Of refuge and concludes thee miserable
, False,,Beyond all past example and future
, False,,To Satan only like both crime and doom
, False,,Oh Conscience into what abyss of fears
, False,,And horrors hast thou driven me out of which
, False,,I find no way from deep to deeper plunged
, False,,Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
, False,,Through the still night not now as ere man fell
, False,,Wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
, False,,Accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom
, False,,Which to his evil conscience represented
, False,,All things with double terror On the ground
, False,,Outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
, False,,Cursed his creation Death as oft accused
, False,,Of tardy execution since denounced
, False,,The day of his offence Why comes not Death
, False,,Said he with one thriceacceptable stroke
, False,,To end me Shall Truth fail to keep her word
, False,,Justice divine not hasten to be just
, False,,But Death comes not at call justice divine
, False,,Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries
, False,,Oh woods Oh fountains hillocks dales and bowers
, False,,With other echo late I taught your shades
, False,,To answer and resound far other song
, False,,Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld
, False,,Desolate where she sat approaching nigh
, False,,Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed
, False,,But her with stern regard he thus repelled
, False,,Out of my sight thou serpent That name best
, False,,Befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
, False,,And hateful nothing wants but that thy shape
, False,,Like his and color serpentine may show
, False,,Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
, False,,Henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
, False,,To hellish falsehood snare them But for thee
, False,,I had persisted happy had not thy pride
, False,,And wandering vanity when least was safe
, False,,Rejected my forewarning and disdained
, False,,Not to be trusted longing to be seen
, False,,Though by the Devil himself him overweening
, False,,To overreach but with the serpent meeting
, False,,Fooled and beguiled by him thou I by thee
, False,,To trust thee from my side imagined wise
, False,,Constant mature proof against all assaults
, False,,And understood not all was but a show
, False,,Rather than solid virtue all but a rib
, False,,Crooked by nature bent as now appears
, False,,More to the part sinister from me drawn
, False,,Well if thrown out as supernumerary
, False,,To my just number found Oh why did God
, False,,Creator wise that peopled highest Heaven
, False,,With Spirits masculine create at last
, False,,This novelty on earth this fair defect
, False,,Of nature and not fill the world at once
, False,,With men as angels without feminine
, False,,Or find some other way to generate
, False,,Mankind This mischief had not been befallen
, False,,And more that shall befall innumerable
, False,,Disturbances on earth through female snares
, False,,And strait conjunction with this sex for either
, False,,He never shall find out fit mate but such
, False,,As some misfortune brings him or mistake
, False,,Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
, False,,Through her perverseness but shall see her gained
, False,,By a far worse or if she love withheld
, False,,By parents or his happiest choice too late
, False,,Shall meet already linked and wedlockbound
, False,,To a fell adversary his hate or shame
, False,,Which infinite calamity shall cause
, False,,To human life and household peace confound
, False,,He added not and from her turned but Eve
, False,,Not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
, False,,And tresses all disordered at his feet
, False,,Fell humble and embracing them besought
, False,,His peace and thus proceeded in her plaint
, False,,Forsake me not thus Adam witness Heaven
, False,,What love sincere and reverence in my heart
, False,,I bear thee and unweeting have offended
, False,,Unhappily deceived Thy suppliant
, False,,I beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not
, False,,Whereon I live thy gentle looks thy aid

, False,,Whither shall I betake me where subsist
, False,,While yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps
, False,,Between us two let there be peace both joining
, False,,As joined in injuries one enmity
, False,,Against a foe by doom express assigned us
, False,,That cruel Serpent On me exercise not
, False,,Thy hatred for this misery befallen
, False,,On me already lost me than thyself
, False,,More miserable Both have sinned but thou
, False,,Against God only I against God and thee
, False,,And to the place of judgment will return
, False,,There with my cries importune Heaven that all
, False,,The sentence from thy head removed may light
, False,,On me sole cause to thee of all this woe
, False,,Me me only just object of his ire
, False,,She ended weeping and her lowly plight
, False,,Immoveable till peace obtained from fault
, False,,Acknowledged and deplored in Adam wrought
, False,,Commiseration Soon his heart relented
, False,,Towards her his life so late and sole delight

, False,,Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking
, False,,His counsel whom she had displeased his aid
, False,,As one disarmed his anger all he lost
, False,,And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon
, False,,Unwary and too desirous as before
, False,,So now of what thou knowest not who desirest
, False,,The punishment all on thyself alas
, False,,Bear thine own first ill able to sustain
, False,,His full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part
, False,,And my displeasure bearest so ill If prayers
, False,,Could alter high decrees I to that place
, False,,Would speed before thee and be louder heard
, False,,That on my head all might be visited
, False,,Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven
, False,,To me committed and by me exposed
, False,,But rise let us no more contend nor blame
, False,,Each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
, False,,In offices of love how we may lighten
, False,,Each others burden in our share of woe
, False,,Since this days death denounced if aught I see
, False,,Will prove no sudden but a slowpaced evil
, False,,A long days dying to augment our pain
, False,,And to our seed O hapless seed derived
, False,,To whom thus Eve recovering heart replied
, False,,Adam by sad experiment I know
, False,,How little weight my words with thee can find
, False,,Found so erroneous thence by just event
, False,,Found so unfortunate Nevertheless
, False,,Restored by thee vile as I am to place
, False,,Of new acceptance hopeful to regain
, False,,Thy love the sole contentment of my heart
, False,,Living or dying from thee I will not hide
, False,,What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen
, False,,Tending to some relief of our extremes
, False,,Or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable
, False,,As in our evils and of easier choice
, False,,If care of our descent perplex us most
, False,,Which must be born to certain woe devoured
, False,,By Death at last and miserable it is
, False,,To be to others cause of misery
, False,,Our own begotten and of our loins to bring
, False,,Into this cursed world a woeful race
, False,,That after wretched life must be at last
, False,,Food for so foul a monster in thy power
, False,,It lies yet ere conception to prevent
, False,,The race unblest to being yet unbegot
, False,,Childless thou art childless remain so Death
, False,,Shall be deceived his glut and with us two
, False,,Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw
, False,,But if thou judge it hard and difficult
, False,,Conversing looking loving to abstain
, False,,From loves due rights nuptial embraces sweet
, False,,And with desire to languish without hope
, False,,Before the present object languishing
, False,,With like desire which would be misery
, False,,And torment less than none of what we dread
, False,,Then both ourselves and seed at once to free
, False,,From what we fear for both let us make short
, False,,Let us seek Death or he not found supply
, False,,With our own hands his office on ourselves
, False,,Why stand we longer shivering under fears
, False,,That show no end but death and have the power
, False,,Of many ways to die the shortest choosing
, False,,Destruction with destruction to destroy
, False,,She ended here or vehement despair
, False,,Broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
, False,,Had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale
, False,,But Adam with such counsel nothing swayed
, False,,To better hopes his more attentive mind
, False,,Laboring had raised and thus to Eve replied
, False,,Eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
, False,,To argue in thee something more sublime
, False,,And excellent than what thy mind contemns
, False,,But selfdestruction therefore sought refutes
, False,,That excellence thought in thee and implies
, False,,Not thy contempt but anguish and regret
, False,,For loss of life and pleasure overloved
, False,,Or if thou covet death as utmost end
, False,,Of misery so thinking to evade
, False,,The penalty pronounced doubt not but God
, False,,Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
, False,,To be forestalled much more I fear lest death
, False,,So snatched will not exempt us from the pain
, False,,We are by doom to pay rather such acts
, False,,Of contumacy will provoke the Highest
, False,,To make death in us live Then let us seek
, False,,Some safer resolution which methinks
, False,,I have in view calling to mind with heed
, False,,Part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
, False,,The Serpents head piteous amends unless
, False,,Be meant whom I conjecture our grand foe
, False,,Satan who in the serpent hath contrived
, False,,Against us this deceit To crush his head
, False,,Would be revenge indeed which will be lost
, False,,By death brought on ourselves or childless days
, False,,Resolved as thou proposest so our foe
, False,,Shall scape his punishment ordained and we
, False,,Instead shall double ours upon our heads
, False,,No more be mentioned then of violence
, False,,Against ourselves and willful barrenness
, False,,That cuts us off from hope and savors only
, False,,Rancor and pride impatience and despite
, False,,Reluctance against God and his just yoke
, False,,Laid on our necks Remember with what mild
, False,,And gracious temper he both heard and judged
, False,,Without wrath or reviling we expected
, False,,Immediate dissolution which we thought
, False,,Was meant by death that day when lo to thee
, False,,Pains only in childbearing were foretold
, False,,And bringing forth soon recompensed with joy
, False,,Fruit of thy womb On me the curse aslope
, False,,Glanced on the ground with labor I must earn
, False,,My bread what harm Idleness had been worse
, False,,My labor will sustain me and lest cold
, False,,Or heat should injure us his timely care
, False,,Hath unbesought provided and his hands
, False,,Clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged
, False,,How much more if we pray him will his ear
, False,,Be open and his heart to pity incline
, False,,And teach us further by what means to shun
, False,,The inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow
, False,,Which now the sky with various face begins
, False,,To show us in this mountain while the winds
, False,,Blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks
, False,,Of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
, False,,Some better shroud some better warmth to cherish
, False,,Our limbs benumbed ere this diurnal star
, False,,Leave cold the night how we his gathered beams
, False,,Reflected may with matter sere foment
, False,,Or by collision of two bodies grind
, False,,The air attrite to fire as late the clouds
, False,,Jostling or pushed with winds rude in their shock
, False,,Tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down
, False,,Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine
, False,,And sends a comfortable heat from far

, False,,That I should fear nor sociably mild
, False,,As Raphael that I should much confide
, False,,But solemn and sublime whom not to offend
, False,,With reverence I must meet and thou retire
, False,,He ended and the archangel soon drew nigh
, False,,Not in his shape celestial but as man
, False,,Clad to meet man over his lucid arms
, False,,A military vest of purple flowed
, False,,Livelier than Meliboean or the grain
, False,,Of Sarra worn by kings and heroes old
, False,,In time of truce Iris had dipped the woof

, False,,Inclined not but his coming thus declared
, False,,Adam Heavens high behest no preface needs
, False,,Sufficient that thy prayers are heard and Death
, False,,Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress
, False,,Defeated of his seizure many days
, False,,Given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent

, False,,Must I thus leave thee Paradise thus leave
, False,,Thee native soil these happy walks and shades
, False,,Fit haunt of Gods where I had hope to spend
, False,,Quiet though sad the respite of that day
, False,,That must be mortal to us both Oh flowers
, False,,That never will in other climate grow
, False,,My early visitation and my last
, False,,At even which I bred up with tender hand
, False,,From the first opening bud and gave ye names
, False,,Who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
, False,,Your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount
, False,,Thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
, False,,With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
, False,,How shall I part and whither wander down
, False,,Into a lower world to this obscure
, False,,And wild how shall we breathe in other air
, False,,Less pure accustomed to immortal fruits
, False,,Whom thus the angel interrupted mild
, False,,Lament not Eve but patiently resign
, False,,What justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart
, False,,Thus overfond on that which is not thine
, False,,Thy going is not lonely with thee goes
, False,,Thy husband whom to follow thou art bound
, False,,Where he abides think there thy native soil
, False,,Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
, False,,Recovering and his scattered spirits returned
, False,,To Michael thus his humble words addressed
, False,,Celestial whether among the Thrones or named
, False,,Of them the highest for such of shape may seem
, False,,Prince above princes gently hast thou told
, False,,Thy message which might else in telling wound
, False,,And in performing end us what besides
, False,,Of sorrow and dejection and despair
, False,,Our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring
, False,,Departure from this happy place our sweet
, False,,Recess and only consolation left
, False,,Familiar to our eyes all places else
, False,,Inhospitable appear and desolate
, False,,Nor knowing us nor known And if by prayer
, False,,Incessant I could hope to change the will
, False,,Of Him who all things can I would not cease
, False,,To weary him with my assiduous cries
, False,,But prayer against his absolute decree
, False,,No more avails than breath against the wind
, False,,Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth
, False,,Therefore to his great bidding I submit
, False,,This most afflicts me that departing hence
, False,,As from his face I shall be hid deprived
, False,,His blessed countenance Here I could frequent
, False,,With worship place by place where he vouchsafed
, False,,Presence Divine and to my sons relate
, False,,On this mount he appeared under this tree
, False,,Stood visible among these pines his voice
, False,,I heard here with him at this fountain talked
, False,,So many grateful altars I would rear
, False,,Of grassy turf and pile up every stone
, False,,Of luster from the brook in memory
, False,,Or monument to ages and thereon
, False,,Offer sweetsmelling gums and fruits and flowers
, False,,In yonder nether world where shall I seek
, False,,His bright appearances or footstep trace
, False,,For though I fled him angry yet recalled
, False,,To life prolonged and promised race I now
, False,,Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
, False,,Of glory and far off his steps adore
, False,,To whom thus Michael with regard benign
, False,,Adam thou knowest Heaven his and all the Earth
, False,,Not this rock only his Omnipresence fills
, False,,Land sea and air and every kind that lives
, False,,Fomented by his virtual power and warmed
, False,,All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule
, False,,No despicable gift surmise not then
, False,,His presence to these narrow bounds confined
, False,,Of Paradise or Eden this had been
, False,,Perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
, False,,All generations and had hither come
, False,,From all the ends of the earth to celebrate
, False,,And reverence thee their great progenitor
, False,,But this preeminence thou hast lost brought down
, False,,To dwell on even ground now with thy sons
, False,,Yet doubt not but in valley and in plain
, False,,God is as here and will be found alike
, False,,Present and of his presence many a sign
, False,,Still following thee still compassing thee round
, False,,With goodness and paternal love his face
, False,,Express and of his steps the track divine
, False,,Which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed

, False,,Expect to hear supernal grace contending
, False,,With sinfulness of men thereby to learn
, False,,True patience and to temper joy with fear
, False,,And pious sorrow equally inured
, False,,By moderation either state to bear
, False,,Prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
, False,,Safest thy life and best prepared endure
, False,,Thy mortal passage when it comes Ascend
, False,,This hill let Eve for I have drenched her eyes
, False,,Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest
, False,,As once thou sleptst while she to life was formed
, False,,To whom thus Adam gratefully replied
, False,,Ascend I follow thee safe Guide the path
, False,,Thou leadest me and to the hand of Heaven submit
, False,,However chastening to the evil turn
, False,,My obvious breast arming to overcome
, False,,By suffering and earn rest from labor won
, False,,If so I may attain So both ascend
, False,,In the visions of God It was a hill
, False,,Of Paradise the highest from whose top
, False,,The hemisphere of earth in clearest ken
, False,,Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay
, False,,Not higher that hill nor wider looking round
, False,,Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
, False,,Our second Adam in the wilderness
, False,,To show him all Earths kingdoms and their glory
, False,,His eye might there command wherever stood
, False,,City of old or modern fame the seat
, False,,Of mightiest empire from the destined walls
, False,,Of Cambalu seat of Cathaian Can

, False,,The kingdoms of Almansor Fez and Sus
, False,,Morocco and Algiers and Tremisen
, False,,On Europe thence and where Rome was to sway
, False,,The world in spirit perhaps he also saw
, False,,Rich Meco the seat of Montezuma
, False,,And Cusco in Peru the richer seat
, False,,Of Atabalipa and yet unspoiled
, False,,Guiana whose great city Geryons sons
, False,,Call El Dorado But to nobler sights
, False,,Michael from Adams eyes the film removed
, False,,Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
, False,,Had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue
, False,,The visual nerve for he had much to see
, False,,And from the well of life three drops instilled
, False,,So deep the power of these ingredients pierced
, False,,Even to the inmost seat of mental sight
, False,,That Adam now enforced to close his eyes
, False,,Sunk down and all his spirits became entranced
, False,,But him the gentle angel by the hand
, False,,Soon raised and his attention thus recalled
, False,,Adam now open thine eyes and first behold
, False,,The effects which thy original crime hath wrought
, False,,In some to spring from thee who never touched
, False,,The excepted tree nor with the snake conspired
, False,,Nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive
, False,,Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds
, False,,His eyes he opened and beheld a field
, False,,Part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
, False,,New reaped the other part sheepwalks and folds
, False,,I the midst an altar as the landmark stood
, False,,Rustic of grassy sord thither anon
, False,,A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
, False,,First fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf
, False,,Unculled as came to hand a shepherd next
, False,,More meek came with the firstlings of his flock
, False,,Choicest and best then sacrificing laid
, False,,The inwards and their fat with incense strowed
, False,,On the cleft wood and all due rights performed
, False,,His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven
, False,,Consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam
, False,,The others not for his was not sincere
, False,,Whereat he inly raged and as they talked
, False,,Smote him into the midriff with a stone
, False,,That beat out life he fell and deadly pale
, False,,Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused
, False,,Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
, False,,Dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried
, False,,Oh teacher some great mischief hath befallen
, False,,To that meek man who well had sacrificed
, False,,Is piety thus and pure devotion paid
, False,,To whom Michael thus he also moved replied
, False,,These two are brethren Adam and to come
, False,,Out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain
, False,,For envy that his brothers offering found
, False,,From Heaven acceptance but the bloody fact
, False,,Will be avenged and the others faith approved
, False,,Lose no reward though here thou see him die
, False,,Rolling in dust and gore To which our sire
, False,,Alas both for the deed and for the cause
, False,,But have I now seen Death Is this the way

, False,,More terrible at the entrance than within
, False,,Some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die
, False,,By fire flood famine by intemperance more
, False,,In meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring
, False,,Diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
, False,,Before thee shall appear that thou mayest know
, False,,What misery the inabstinence of Eve
, False,,Shall bring on Men Immediately a place
, False,,Before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark

, False,,Retaining still divine similitude
, False,,In part from such deformities be free
, False,,And for his Makers image sake exempt
, False,,Their Makers image answered Michael then
, False,,Forsook them when themselves they vilified
, False,,To serve ungoverned Appetite and took
, False,,His image whom they served a brutish vice
, False,,Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve
, False,,Therefore so abject is their punishment
