The Life of King Henry the Fifth, True
O for a Muse of fire that would ascend, True
The brightest heaven of invention, True
A kingdom for a stage princes to act, True
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene, True
Then should the warlike Harry like himself, True
Assume the port of Mars and at his heels, True
Leashd in like hounds should famine sword and fire, True
Crouch for employment But pardon and gentles all, True
The flat unraised spirits that have dared, True
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth, True
So great an object can this cockpit hold, True
The vasty fields of France or may we cram, True
Within this wooden O the very casques, True
That did affright the air at Agincourt, True
O pardon since a crooked figure may, True
Attest in little place a million, True
And let us ciphers to this great accompt, True
On your imaginary forces work, True
Suppose within the girdle of these walls, True
Are now confined two mighty monarchies, True
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts, True
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder, True
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts, True
Into a thousand parts divide on man, True
And make imaginary puissance, True
Think when we talk of horses that you see them, True
Printing their proud hoofs i the receiving earth, True
For tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, True
Carry them here and there jumping oer times, True
Turning the accomplishment of many years, True
Into an hourglass for the which supply, True
Admit me Chorus to this history, True
Who prologuelike your humble patience pray, True
Gently to hear kindly to judge our play, True
SCENE I London An antechamber in the KINGS palace, True
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY, True
My lord Ill tell you that self bill is urged, True
Which in the eleventh year of the last kings reign, True
Was like and had indeed against us passd, True
But that the scambling and unquiet time, True
Did push it out of farther question, True
But how my lord shall we resist it now, True
It must be thought on If it pass against us, True
We lose the better half of our possession, True
For all the temporal lands which men devout, True
By testament have given to the church, True
Would they strip from us being valued thus, True
As much as would maintain to the kings honour, True
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, True
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires, True
And to relief of lazars and weak age, True
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil, True
A hundred almshouses right well supplied, True
And to the coffers of the king beside, True
A thousand pounds by the year thus runs the bill, True
This would drink deep, True
Twould drink the cup and all, True
The king is full of grace and fair regard, True
And a true lover of the holy church, True
The courses of his youth promised it not, True
The breath no sooner left his fathers body, True
But that his wildness mortified in him, True
Seemd to die too yea at that very moment, True
Consideration like an angel came, True
And whippd the offending Adam out of him, True
Leaving his body as a paradise, True
To envelop and contain celestial spirits, True
Never was such a sudden scholar made, True
Never came reformation in a flood, True
With such a heady currance scouring faults, True
Nor never Hydraheaded wilfulness, True
So soon did lose his seat and all at once, True
We are blessed in the change, True
Hear him but reason in divinity, True
And alladmiring with an inward wish, True
You would desire the king were made a prelate, True
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs, True
You would say it hath been all in all his study, True
List his discourse of war and you shall hear, True
A fearful battle renderd you in music, True
Turn him to any cause of policy, True
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, True
Familiar as his garter that when he speaks, True
The air a charterd libertine is still, True
And the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears, True
To steal his sweet and honeyd sentences, True
So that the art and practic part of life, True
Must be the mistress to this theoric, True
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it, True
Since his addiction was to courses vain, True
His companies unletterd rude and shallow, True
His hours filld up with riots banquets sports, True
And never noted in him any study, True
Any retirement any sequestration, True
From open haunts and popularity, True
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle, True
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best, True
Neighbourd by fruit of baser quality, True
And so the prince obscured his contemplation, True
Under the veil of wildness which no doubt, True
Grew like the summer grass fastest by night, True
Unseen yet crescive in his faculty, True
It must be so for miracles are ceased, True
And therefore we must needs admit the means, True
How things are perfected, True
How now for mitigation of this bill, True
Urged by the commons Doth his majesty, True
Incline to it or no, True
He seems indifferent, True
Or rather swaying more upon our part, True
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us, True
For I have made an offer to his majesty, True
Upon our spiritual convocation, True
And in regard of causes now in hand, True
Which I have opend to his grace at large, True
As touching France to give a greater sum, True
Than ever at one time the clergy yet, True
Did to his predecessors part withal, True
How did this offer seem received my lord, True
With good acceptance of his majesty, True
Save that there was not time enough to hear, True
As I perceived his grace would fain have done, True
The severals and unhidden passages, True
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms, True
And generally to the crown and seat of France, True
Derived from Edward his greatgrandfather, True
What was the impediment that broke this off, True
The French ambassador upon that instant, True
Craved audience and the hour I think is come, True
To give him hearing is it four oclock, True
Then go we in to know his embassy, True
Which I could with a ready guess declare, True
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it, True
Ill wait upon you and I long to hear it, True
SCENE II The same The Presence chamber, True
Enter KING HENRY V GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER WARWICK WESTMORELAND and Attendants, True
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury, True
Not here in presence, True
Send for him good uncle, True
Shall we call in the ambassador my liege, True
Not yet my cousin we would be resolved, True
Before we hear him of some things of weight, True
That task our thoughts concerning us and France, True
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP of ELY, True
God and his angels guard your sacred throne, True
And make you long become it, True
My learned lord we pray you to proceed, True
And justly and religiously unfold, True
Why the law Salique that they have in France, True
Or should or should not bar us in our claim, True
And God forbid my dear and faithful lord, True
That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading, True
Or nicely charge your understanding soul, True
With opening titles miscreate whose right, True
Suits not in native colours with the truth, True
For God doth know how many now in health, True
Shall drop their blood in approbation, True
Of what your reverence shall incite us to, True
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, True
How you awake our sleeping sword of war, True
We charge you in the name of God take heed, True
For never two such kingdoms did contend, True
Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops, True
Are every one a woe a sore complaint, True
Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords, True
That make such waste in brief mortality, True
Under this conjuration speak my lord, True
For we will hear note and believe in heart, True
That what you speak is in your conscience washd, True
As pure as sin with baptism, True
Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers, True
That owe yourselves your lives and services, True
To this imperial throne There is no bar, True
To make against your highness claim to France, True
But this which they produce from Pharamond, True
In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant, True
No woman shall succeed in Salique land, True
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze, True
To be the realm of France and Pharamond, True
The founder of this law and female bar, True
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm, True
That the land Salique is in Germany, True
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe, True
Where Charles the Great having subdued the Saxons, True
There left behind and settled certain French, True
Who holding in disdain the German women, True
For some dishonest manners of their life, True
Establishd then this law to wit no female, True
Should be inheritrix in Salique land, True
Which Salique as I said twixt Elbe and Sala, True
Is at this day in Germany calld Meisen, True
Then doth it well appear that Salique law, True
Was not devised for the realm of France, True
Nor did the French possess the Salique land, True
Until four hundred one and twenty years, True
After defunction of King Pharamond, True
Idly supposed the founder of this law, True
Who died within the year of our redemption, True
Four hundred twentysix and Charles the Great, True
Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French, True
Beyond the river Sala in the year, True
Eight hundred five Besides their writers say, True
King Pepin which deposed Childeric, True
Did as heir general being descended, True
Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair, True
Make claim and title to the crown of France, True
Hugh Capet also who usurped the crown, True
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine sole heir male, True
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, True
To find his title with some shows of truth, True
Through in pure truth it was corrupt and naught, True
Conveyd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare, True
Daughter to Charlemain who was the son, True
To Lewis the emperor and Lewis the son, True
Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth, True
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, True
Could not keep quiet in his conscience, True
Wearing the crown of France till satisfied, True
That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother, True
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, True
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine, True
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great, True
Was reunited to the crown of France, True
So that as clear as is the summers sun, True
King Pepins title and Hugh Capets claim, True
King Lewis his satisfaction all appear, True
To hold in right and title of the female, True
So do the kings of France unto this day, True
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law, True
To bar your highness claiming from the female, True
And rather choose to hide them in a net, True
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles, True
Usurpd from you and your progenitors, True
May I with right and conscience make this claim, True
The sin upon my head dread sovereign, True
For in the book of Numbers is it writ, True
When the man dies let the inheritance, True
Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord, True
Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag, True
Look back into your mighty ancestors, True
Go my dread lord to your greatgrandsires tomb, True
From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit, True
And your greatuncles Edward the Black Prince, True
Who on the French ground playd a tragedy, True
Making defeat on the full power of France, True
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill, True
Stood smiling to behold his lions whelp, True
Forage in blood of French nobility, True
O noble English that could entertain, True
With half their forces the full Pride of France, True
And let another half stand laughing by, True
All out of work and cold for action, True
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead, True
And with your puissant arm renew their feats, True
You are their heir you sit upon their throne, True
The blood and courage that renowned them, True
Runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege, True
Is in the very Maymorn of his youth, True
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises, True
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth, True
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself, True
As did the former lions of your blood, True
They know your grace hath cause and means and might, True
So hath your highness never king of England, True
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects, True
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England, True
And lie paviliond in the fields of France, True
O let their bodies follow my dear liege, True
With blood and sword and fire to win your right, True
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty, True
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum, True
As never did the clergy at one time, True
Bring in to any of your ancestors, True
We must not only arm to invade the French, True
But lay down our proportions to defend, True
Against the Scot who will make road upon us, True
They of those marches gracious sovereign, True
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend, True
Our inland from the pilfering borderers, True
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, True
But fear the main intendment of the Scot, True
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us, True
For you shall read that my greatgrandfather, True
Never went with his forces into France, True
But that the Scot on his unfurnishd kingdom, True
Came pouring like the tide into a breach, True
With ample and brim fulness of his force, True
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays, True
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns, True
That England being empty of defence, True
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood, True
She hath been then more feard than harmd my liege, True
For hear her but exampled by herself, True
When all her chivalry hath been in France, True
And she a mourning widow of her nobles, True
She hath herself not only well defended, True
But taken and impounded as a stray, True
The King of Scots whom she did send to France, True
To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner kings, True
And make her chronicle as rich with praise, True
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea, True
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries, True
But theres a saying very old and true, True
If that you will France win, True
Then with Scotland first begin, True
For once the eagle England being in prey, True
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot, True
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, True
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, True
To tear and havoc more than she can eat, True
It follows then the cat must stay at home, True
Yet that is but a crushd necessity, True
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries, True
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves, True
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, True
The advised head defends itself at home, True
For government though high and low and lower, True
Put into parts doth keep in one consent, True
Congreeing in a full and natural close, True
Therefore doth heaven divide, True
The state of man in divers functions, True
Setting endeavour in continual motion, True
To which is fixed as an aim or butt, True
Obedience for so work the honeybees, True
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach, True
The act of order to a peopled kingdom, True
They have a king and officers of sorts, True
Where some like magistrates correct at home, True
Others like merchants venture trade abroad, True
Others like soldiers armed in their stings, True
Make boot upon the summers velvet buds, True
Which pillage they with merry march bring home, True
To the tentroyal of their emperor, True
Who busied in his majesty surveys, True
The singing masons building roofs of gold, True
The civil citizens kneading up the honey, True
The poor mechanic porters crowding in, True
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate, True
The sadeyed justice with his surly hum, True
Delivering oer to executors pale, True
The lazy yawning drone I this infer, True
That many things having full reference, True
To one consent may work contrariously, True
As many arrows loosed several ways, True
Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town, True
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea, True
As many lines close in the dials centre, True
So may a thousand actions once afoot, True
End in one purpose and be all well borne, True
Without defeat Therefore to France my liege, True
Divide your happy England into four, True
Whereof take you one quarter into France, True
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake, True
If we with thrice such powers left at home, True
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, True
Let us be worried and our nation lose, True
The name of hardiness and policy, True
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin, True
Exeunt some Attendants, True
Now are we well resolved and by Gods help, True
And yours the noble sinews of our power, True
France being ours well bend it to our awe, True
Or break it all to pieces or there well sit, True
Ruling in large and ample empery, True
Oer France and all her almost kingly dukedoms, True
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, True
Tombless with no remembrance over them, True
Either our history shall with full mouth, True
Speak freely of our acts or else our grave, True
Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth, True
Not worshippd with a waxen epitaph, True
Enter Ambassadors of France, True
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure, True
Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear, True
Your greeting is from him not from the king, True
Mayt please your majesty to give us leave, True
Freely to render what we have in charge, True
Or shall we sparingly show you far off, True
The Dauphins meaning and our embassy, True
We are no tyrant but a Christian king, True
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject, True
As are our wretches fetterd in our prisons, True
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness, True
Tell us the Dauphins mind, True
Your highness lately sending into France, True
Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right, True
Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third, True
In answer of which claim the prince our master, True
Says that you savour too much of your youth, True
And bids you be advised theres nought in France, True
That can be with a nimble galliard won, True
You cannot revel into dukedoms there, True
He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit, True
This tun of treasure and in lieu of this, True
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim, True
Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks, True
What treasure uncle, True
Tennisballs my liege, True
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us, True
His present and your pains we thank you for, True
When we have marchd our rackets to these balls, True
We will in France by Gods grace play a set, True
Shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard, True
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler, True
That all the courts of France will be disturbd, True
With chaces And we understand him well, True
How he comes oer us with our wilder days, True
Not measuring what use we made of them, True
We never valued this poor seat of England, True
And therefore living hence did give ourself, True
To barbarous licence as tis ever common, True
That men are merriest when they are from home, True
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, True
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness, True
When I do rouse me in my throne of France, True
For that I have laid by my majesty, True
And plodded like a man for workingdays, True
But I will rise there with so full a glory, True
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, True
Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us, True
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his, True
Hath turnd his balls to gunstones and his soul, True
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance, True
That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows, True
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands, True
Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down, True
And some are yet ungotten and unborn, True
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphins scorn, True
But this lies all within the will of God, True
To whom I do appeal and in whose name, True
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on, True
To venge me as I may and to put forth, True
My rightful hand in a wellhallowd cause, True
So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin, True
His jest will savour but of shallow wit, True
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it, True
Convey them with safe conduct Fare you well, True
This was a merry message, True
We hope to make the sender blush at it, True
Therefore my lords omit no happy hour, True
That may give furtherance to our expedition, True
For we have now no thought in us but France, True
Save those to God that run before our business, True
Therefore let our proportions for these wars, True
Be soon collected and all things thought upon, True
That may with reasonable swiftness add, True
More feathers to our wings for God before, True
Well chide this Dauphin at his fathers door, True
Therefore let every man now task his thought, True
That this fair action may on foot be brought, True
Now all the youth of England are on fire, True
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies, True
Now thrive the armourers and honours thought, True
Reigns solely in the breast of every man, True
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, True
Following the mirror of all Christian kings, True
With winged heels as English Mercuries, True
For now sits Expectation in the air, True
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point, True
With crowns imperial crowns and coronets, True
Promised to Harry and his followers, True
The French advised by good intelligence, True
Of this most dreadful preparation, True
Shake in their fear and with pale policy, True
Seek to divert the English purposes, True
O England model to thy inward greatness, True
Like little body with a mighty heart, True
What mightst thou do that honour would thee do, True
Were all thy children kind and natural, True
But see thy fault France hath in thee found out, True
A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills, True
With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men, True
One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second, True
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third, True
Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland, True
Have for the gilt of FranceO guilt indeed, True
Confirmd conspiracy with fearful France, True
And by their hands this grace of kings must die, True
If hell and treason hold their promises, True
Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton, True
Linger your patience on and well digest, True
The abuse of distance force a play, True
The sum is paid the traitors are agreed, True
The king is set from London and the scene, True
Is now transported gentles to Southampton, True
There is the playhouse now there must you sit, True
And thence to France shall we convey you safe, True
And bring you back charming the narrow seas, True
To give you gentle pass for if we may, True
Well not offend one stomach with our play, True
But till the king come forth and not till then, True
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene, True

Crowned with faith and constant loyalty, True
The king hath note of all that they intend, True
By interception which they dream not of, True
Nay but the man that was his bedfellow, True
Whom he hath dulld and cloyd with gracious favours, True
That he should for a foreign purse so sell, True
His sovereigns life to death and treachery, True

Doing the execution and the act, True
For which we have in head assembled them, True
No doubt my liege if each man do his best, True
I doubt not that since we are well persuaded, True

Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish, True
Success and conquest to attend on us, True
Never was monarch better feard and loved, True
Than is your majesty theres not I think a subject, True

Under the sweet shade of your government, True
True those that were your fathers enemies, True

With hearts create of duty and of zeal, True
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness, True
And shall forget the office of our hand, True

So service shall with steeled sinews toil, True
And labour shall refresh itself with hope, True
To do your grace incessant services, True
We judge no less Uncle of Exeter, True

Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind, True
O let us yet be merciful, True
So may your highness and yet punish too, True
You show great mercy if you give him life, True
After the taste of much correction, True
Alas your too much love and care of me, True
Are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch, True
If little faults proceeding on distemper, True
Shall not be winkd at how shall we stretch our eye, True
When capital crimes chewd swallowd and digested, True
Appear before us Well yet enlarge that man, True
Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care, True
And tender preservation of our person, True
Would have him punished And now to our French causes, True

Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there, True
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood, True
I do confess my fault, True
And do submit me to your highness mercy, True
To which we all appeal, True
The mercy that was quick in us but late, True
By your own counsel is suppressd and killd, True
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy, True
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms, True
As dogs upon their masters worrying you, True
See you my princes and my noble peers, True
These English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here, True
You know how apt our love was to accord, True
To furnish him with all appertinents, True
Belonging to his honour and this man, True
Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired, True
And sworn unto the practises of France, True
To kill us here in Hampton to the which, True
This knight no less for bounty bound to us, True
Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O, True
What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel, True
Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature, True
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, True
That knewst the very bottom of my soul, True
That almost mightst have coind me into gold, True
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use, True
May it be possible that foreign hire, True
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil, True
That might annoy my finger tis so strange, True
That though the truth of it stands off as gross, True
As black and white my eye will scarcely see it, True
Treason and murder ever kept together, True
As two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose, True
Working so grossly in a natural cause, True
That admiration did not whoop at them, True
But thou gainst all proportion didst bring in, True
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder, True
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was, True
That wrought upon thee so preposterously, True
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence, True
All other devils that suggest by treasons, True
Do botch and bungle up damnation, True
With patches colours and with forms being fetchd, True
From glistering semblances of piety, True
But he that temperd thee bade thee stand up, True
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, True
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor, True
If that same demon that hath gulld thee thus, True
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world, True
He might return to vasty Tartar back, True
And tell the legions I can never win, True
A soul so easy as that Englishmans, True
O how hast thou with jealousy infected, True
The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful, True
Why so didst thou seem they grave and learned, True
Why so didst thou come they of noble family, True
Why so didst thou seem they religious, True
Why so didst thou or are they spare in diet, True
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger, True
Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood, True
Garnishd and deckd in modest complement, True
Not working with the eye without the ear, True
And but in purged judgment trusting neither, True
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem, True
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot, True
To mark the fullfraught man and best indued, True
With some suspicion I will weep for thee, True
For this revolt of thine methinks is like, True
Another fall of man Their faults are open, True
Arrest them to the answer of the law, True
And God acquit them of their practises, True
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of, True
Richard Earl of Cambridge, True

Our purposes God justly hath discoverd, True
And I repent my fault more than my death, True
Which I beseech your highness to forgive, True
Although my body pay the price of it, True
For me the gold of France did not seduce, True
Although I did admit it as a motive, True
The sooner to effect what I intended, True
But God be thanked for prevention, True
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice, True
Beseeching God and you to pardon me, True
Never did faithful subject more rejoice, True

Prevented from a damned enterprise, True
My fault but not my body pardon sovereign, True
God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence, True
You have conspired against our royal person, True
Joind with an enemy proclaimd and from his coffers, True
Received the golden earnest of our death, True
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter, True
His princes and his peers to servitude, True
His subjects to oppression and contempt, True
And his whole kingdom into desolation, True
Touching our person seek we no revenge, True
But we our kingdoms safety must so tender, True
Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws, True
We do deliver you Get you therefore hence, True
Poor miserable wretches to your death, True
The taste whereof God of his mercy give, True
You patience to endure and true repentance, True
Of all your dear offences Bear them hence, True
Exeunt CAMBRIDGE SCROOP and GREY guarded, True
Now lords for France the enterprise whereof, True
Shall be to you as us like glorious, True

Since God so graciously hath brought to light, True
This dangerous treason lurking in our way, True
To hinder our beginnings We doubt not now, True
But every rub is smoothed on our way, True
Then forth dear countrymen let us deliver, True
Our puissance into the hand of God, True
Putting it straight in expedition, True
Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance, True
No king of England if not king of France, True

SCENE IV France The KINGS palace, True
Flourish Enter the FRENCH KING the DAUPHIN the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE the Constable and others, True
Thus comes the English with full power upon us, True
And more than carefully it us concerns, True
To answer royally in our defences, True
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne, True
Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth, True
And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch, True
To line and new repair our towns of war, True
With men of courage and with means defendant, True
For England his approaches makes as fierce, True
As waters to the sucking of a gulf, True
It fits us then to be as provident, True
As fear may teach us out of late examples, True
Left by the fatal and neglected English, True
My most redoubted father, True
It is most meet we arm us gainst the foe, True
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom, True
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question, True
But that defences musters preparations, True
Should be maintaind assembled and collected, True
As were a war in expectation, True
Therefore I say tis meet we all go forth, True
To view the sick and feeble parts of France, True
And let us do it with no show of fear, True
No with no more than if we heard that England, True
Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance, True
For my good liege she is so idly kingd, True
Her sceptre so fantastically borne, True
By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth, True
That fear attends her not, True
O peace Prince Dauphin, True
You are too much mistaken in this king, True
Question your grace the late ambassadors, True
With what great state he heard their embassy, True
How well supplied with noble counsellors, True
How modest in exception and withal, True
How terrible in constant resolution, True
And you shall find his vanities forespent, True
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, True
Covering discretion with a coat of folly, True
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots, True
That shall first spring and be most delicate, True
Well tis not so my lord high constable, True
But though we think it so it is no matter, True
In cases of defence tis best to weigh, True
The enemy more mighty than he seems, True
So the proportions of defence are filld, True
Which of a weak or niggardly projection, True
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting, True
Think we King Harry strong, True
And princes look you strongly arm to meet him, True
The kindred of him hath been fleshd upon us, True
And he is bred out of that bloody strain, True
That haunted us in our familiar paths, True
Witness our too much memorable shame, True
When Cressy battle fatally was struck, True
And all our princes captivd by the hand, True
Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales, True
Whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing, True
Up in the air crownd with the golden sun, True
Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him, True
Mangle the work of nature and deface, True
The patterns that by God and by French fathers, True
Had twenty years been made This is a stem, True
Of that victorious stock and let us fear, True
The native mightiness and fate of him, True
Ambassadors from Harry King of England, True
Do crave admittance to your majesty, True
Well give them present audience Go and bring them, True
Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords, True
You see this chase is hotly followd friends, True
Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs, True
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten, True
Runs far before them Good my sovereign, True
Take up the English short and let them know, True
Of what a monarchy you are the head, True
Selflove my liege is not so vile a sin, True
Reenter Lords with EXETER and train, True
From our brother England, True
From him and thus he greets your majesty, True
He wills you in the name of God Almighty, True
That you divest yourself and lay apart, True
The borrowd glories that by gift of heaven, True
By law of nature and of nations long, True
To him and to his heirs namely the crown, True
And all widestretched honours that pertain, True
By custom and the ordinance of times, True
Unto the crown of France That you may know, True
Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim, True
Pickd from the wormholes of longvanishd days, True
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked, True
He sends you this most memorable line, True
In every branch truly demonstrative, True
Willing to overlook this pedigree, True
And when you find him evenly derived, True
From his most famed of famous ancestors, True
Edward the Third he bids you then resign, True
Your crown and kingdom indirectly held, True
From him the native and true challenger, True
Or else what follows, True
Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown, True
Even in your hearts there will he rake for it, True
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming, True
In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove, True
That if requiring fail he will compel, True
And bids you in the bowels of the Lord, True
Deliver up the crown and to take mercy, True
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war, True
Opens his vasty jaws and on your head, True
Turning the widows tears the orphans cries, True
The dead mens blood the pining maidens groans, True
For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers, True
That shall be swallowd in this controversy, True
This is his claim his threatening and my message, True
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here, True
To whom expressly I bring greeting too, True
For us we will consider of this further, True
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent, True
Back to our brother England, True
I stand here for him what to him from England, True
Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt, True
And any thing that may not misbecome, True
The mighty sender doth he prize you at, True
Thus says my king an if your fathers highness, True
Do not in grant of all demands at large, True
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty, True
Hell call you to so hot an answer of it, True
That caves and womby vaultages of France, True
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock, True
In second accent of his ordnance, True
Say if my father render fair return, True
It is against my will for I desire, True
Nothing but odds with England to that end, True
As matching to his youth and vanity, True
I did present him with the Paris balls, True
Hell make your Paris Louvre shake for it, True
Were it the mistresscourt of mighty Europe, True
And be assured youll find a difference, True
As we his subjects have in wonder found, True
Between the promise of his greener days, True
And these he masters now now he weighs time, True
Even to the utmost grain that you shall read, True
In your own losses if he stay in France, True
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full, True
Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king, True
Come here himself to question our delay, True
For he is footed in this land already, True
You shall be soon dispatchs with fair conditions, True
A night is but small breath and little pause, True
To answer matters of this consequence, True
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies, True
In motion of no less celerity, True
Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen, True
The wellappointed king at Hampton pier, True
Embark his royalty and his brave fleet, True
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning, True
Play with your fancies and in them behold, True
Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing, True
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give, True
To sounds confused behold the threaden sails, True
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind, True
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowd sea, True
Breasting the lofty surge O do but think, True
You stand upon the ravage and behold, True
A city on the inconstant billows dancing, True
For so appears this fleet majestical, True
Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow, True
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy, True
And leave your England as dead midnight still, True
Guarded with grandsires babies and old women, True
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance, True
For who is he whose chin is but enrichd, True
With one appearing hair that will not follow, True
These culld and choicedrawn cavaliers to France, True
Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege, True
Behold the ordnance on their carriages, True
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur, True
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back, True
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him, True
Katharine his daughter and with her to dowry, True
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms, True
The offer likes not and the nimble gunner, True
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches, True
Alarum and chambers go off, True
And down goes all before them Still be kind, True
And eke out our performance with your mind, True
SCENE I France Before Harfleur, True

Once more unto the breach dear friends once more, True
Or close the wall up with our English dead, True
In peace theres nothing so becomes a man, True
As modest stillness and humility, True
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, True
Then imitate the action of the tiger, True
Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood, True
Disguise fair nature with hardfavourd rage, True
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect, True
Let pry through the portage of the head, True
Like the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm it, True
As fearfully as doth a galled rock, True
Oerhang and jutty his confounded base, True
Swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean, True
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, True
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit, True
To his full height On on you noblest English, True
Whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof, True
Fathers that like so many Alexanders, True
Have in these parts from morn till even fought, True

That those whom you calld fathers did beget you, True
Be copy now to men of grosser blood, True
And teach them how to war And you good yeoman, True
Whose limbs were made in England show us here, True
The mettle of your pasture let us swear, True
That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not, True
For there is none of you so mean and base, True
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes, True

a man For Bardolph he is whitelivered and, True
redfaced by the means whereof a faces it out but, True
fights not For Pistol he hath a killing tongue, True
and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks, True
words and keeps whole weapons For Nym he hath, True
heard that men of few words are the best men and, True
therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a, True
should be thought a coward but his few bad words, True
are matched with as few good deeds for a never, True
broke any mans head but his own and that was, True
against a post when he was drunk They will steal, True

familiar with mens pockets as their gloves or their, True
handkerchers which makes much against my manhood, True
if I should take from anothers pocket to put into, True
mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I, True
must leave them and seek some better service, True

There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the, True
pridge I think in my very conscience he is as, True
valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is a man of no, True
estimation in the world but did see him do as, True
What do you call him, True
He is called Aunchient Pistol, True
Captain I thee beseech to do me favours, True
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well, True

Ill assure you a uttered as brave words at the, True
bridge as you shall see in a summers day But it, True
is very well what he has spoke to me that is well, True
I warrant you when time is serve, True
Why tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then, True
goes to the wars to grace himself at his return, True
into London under the form of a soldier And such, True
fellows are perfect in the great commanders names, True
and they will learn you by rote where services were, True
done at such and such a sconce at such a breach, True
at such a convoy who came off bravely who was, True
shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on, True

What men have you lost Fluellen, True
The perdition of th athversary hath been very, True
great reasonable great marry for my part I, True

is like to be executed for robbing a church one, True
Bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is, True
all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o, True
fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like, True
a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red, True
but his nose is executed and his fires out, True
We would have all such offenders so cut off and we, True
give express charge that in our marches through the, True
country there be nothing compelled from the, True
villages nothing taken but paid for none of the, True
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language, True

his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him, True
therefore consider of his ransom which must, True
proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we, True
have lost the disgrace we have digested which in, True
weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under, True
For our losses his exchequer is too poor for the, True
effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too, True
faint a number and for our disgrace his own, True
person kneeling at our feet but a weak and, True
worthless satisfaction To this add defiance and, True
tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his, True
followers whose condemnation is pronounced So far, True
my king and master so much my office, True
What is thy name I know thy quality, True
Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back, True
And tell thy king I do not seek him now, True
But could be willing to march on to Calais, True
Without impeachment for to say the sooth, True
Though tis no wisdom to confess so much, True
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage, True
My people are with sickness much enfeebled, True
My numbers lessened and those few I have, True
Almost no better than so many French, True
Who when they were in health I tell thee herald, True
I thought upon one pair of English legs, True
Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God, True
That I do brag thus This your air of France, True
Hath blown that vice in me I must repent, True

My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk, True
My army but a weak and sickly guard, True
Yet God before tell him we will come on, True
Though France himself and such another neighbour, True
Stand in our way Theres for thy labour Montjoy, True
Go bid thy master well advise himself, True
If we may pass we will if we be hinderd, True
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood, True
Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well, True

We would not seek a battle as we are, True

my horse to my mistress, True
I had as lief have my mistress a jade, True
I tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair, True
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow, True
Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et, True

From camp to camp through the foul womb of night, True
The hum of either army stilly sounds, True
That the fixed sentinels almost receive, True
The secret whispers of each others watch, True
Fire answers fire and through their paly flames, True
Each battle sees the others umberd face, True
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs, True
Piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents, True
The armourers accomplishing the knights, True
With busy hammers closing rivets up, True
Give dreadful note of preparation, True

Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent, True
Let him cry Praise and glory on his head, True
For forth he goes and visits all his host, True
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile, True
And calls them brothers friends and countrymen, True
Upon his royal face there is no note, True
How dread an army hath enrounded him, True
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour, True
Unto the weary and allwatched night, True
But freshly looks and overbears attaint, True
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty, True
That every wretch pining and pale before, True
Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks, True
A largess universal like the sun, True
His liberal eye doth give to every one, True
Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all, True
Behold as may unworthiness define, True
A little touch of Harry in the night, True
And so our scene must to the battle fly, True
WhereO for pitywe shall much disgrace, True

find I warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle, True
nor pibble pabble in Pompeys camp I warrant you, True
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the, True
cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety, True
of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise, True
Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night, True
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating, True
coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also, True
look you be an ass and a fool and a prating, True
coxcomb in your own conscience now, True
I pray you and beseech you that you will, True
Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN, True
Though it appear a little out of fashion, True
There is much care and valour in this Welshman, True
Enter three soldiers JOHN BATES ALEXANDER COURT and MICHAEL WILLIAMS, True
Brother John Bates is not that the morning which, True
I think it be but we have no great cause to desire, True
We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think, True
we shall never see the end of it Who goes there, True
Under what captain serve you, True
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham, True
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I, True
pray you what thinks he of our estate, True
Even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be, True
washed off the next tide, True
He hath not told his thought to the king, True
No nor it is not meet he should For though I, True
speak it to you I think the king is but a man as I, True
am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the, True
element shows to him as it doth to me all his, True
senses have but human conditions his ceremonies, True
laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and, True
though his affections are higher mounted than ours, True
yet when they stoop they stoop with the like, True
wing Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we, True
do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish, True
as ours are yet in reason no man should possess, True
him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing, True
it should dishearten his army, True
He may show what outward courage he will but I, True
believe as cold a night as tis he could wish, True
himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he, True
were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here, True
By my troth I will speak my conscience of the king, True
I think he would not wish himself any where but, True
Then I would he were here alone so should he be, True
sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved, True
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here, True
alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens, True
minds methinks I could not die any where so, True
contented as in the kings company his cause being, True
just and his quarrel honourable, True
Thats more than we know, True
Ay or more than we should seek after for we know, True
enough if we know we are the kings subjects if, True
his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes, True
the crime of it out of us, True
But if the cause be not good the king himself hath, True
a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and, True
arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join, True
together at the latter day and cry all We died at, True
such a place some swearing some crying for a, True
surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind, True
them some upon the debts they owe some upon their, True
children rawly left I am afeard there are few die, True
well that die in a battle for how can they, True
charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their, True
argument Now if these men do not die well it, True
will be a black matter for the king that led them to, True
it whom to disobey were against all proportion of, True
So if a son that is by his father sent about, True
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the, True
imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be, True
imposed upon his father that sent him or if a, True
servant under his masters command transporting a, True
sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in, True
many irreconciled iniquities you may call the, True
business of the master the author of the servants, True
damnation but this is not so the king is not, True
bound to answer the particular endings of his, True
soldiers the father of his son nor the master of, True
his servant for they purpose not their death when, True
they purpose their services Besides there is no, True
king be his cause never so spotless if it come to, True
the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all, True
unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them, True
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder, True
some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of, True
perjury some making the wars their bulwark that, True
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with, True
pillage and robbery Now if these men have, True
defeated the law and outrun native punishment, True
though they can outstrip men they have no wings to, True
fly from God war is his beadle war is vengeance, True
so that here men are punished for beforebreach of, True
the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where, True
they feared the death they have borne life away, True
and where they would be safe they perish then if, True
they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of, True
their damnation than he was before guilty of those, True
impieties for the which they are now visited Every, True
subjects duty is the kings but every subjects, True
soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in, True
the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every, True
mote out of his conscience and dying so death, True
is to him advantage or not dying the time was, True
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained, True
and in him that escapes it were not sin to think, True
that making God so free an offer He let him, True
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach, True
others how they should prepare, True
Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon, True
his own head the king is not to answer it, True
But I do not desire he should answer for me and, True
yet I determine to fight lustily for him, True
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed, True
Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but, True
when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we, True
If I live to see it I will never trust his word after, True
You pay him then Thats a perilous shot out of an, True
eldergun that a poor and private displeasure can, True
do against a monarch you may as well go about to, True
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a, True
peacocks feather Youll never trust his word, True
after come tis a foolish saying, True
Your reproof is something too round I should be, True
angry with you if the time were convenient, True
Let it be a quarrel between us if you live, True
How shall I know thee again, True
Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my, True
bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it I, True
will make it my quarrel, True
Heres my glove give me another of thine, True
This will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come, True
to me and say after tomorrow This is my glove, True
by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear, True
If ever I live to see it I will challenge it, True
Thou darest as well be hanged, True
Well I will do it though I take thee in the, True
Keep thy word fare thee well, True
Be friends you English fools be friends we have, True
French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon, True
Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to, True
one they will beat us for they bear them on their, True
shoulders but it is no English treason to cut, True
French crowns and tomorrow the king himself will, True
Upon the king let us our lives our souls, True
Our debts our careful wives, True
Our children and our sins lay on the king, True
We must bear all O hard condition, True
Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath, True
Of every fool whose sense no more can feel, True
But his own wringing What infinite heartsease, True
Must kings neglect that private men enjoy, True
And what have kings that privates have not too, True
Save ceremony save general ceremony, True
And what art thou thou idle ceremony, True
What kind of god art thou that sufferst more, True
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers, True
What are thy rents what are thy comings in, True
O ceremony show me but thy worth, True
What is thy soul of adoration, True
Art thou aught else but place degree and form, True
Creating awe and fear in other men, True
Wherein thou art less happy being feard, True
Than they in fearing, True
What drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet, True
But poisond flattery O be sick great greatness, True
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure, True
Thinkst thou the fiery fever will go out, True
With titles blown from adulation, True
Will it give place to flexure and low bending, True
Canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee, True
Command the health of it No thou proud dream, True
That playst so subtly with a kings repose, True
I am a king that find thee and I know, True
Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball, True
The sword the mace the crown imperial, True
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl, True
The farced title running fore the king, True
The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp, True
That beats upon the high shore of this world, True
No not all these thricegorgeous ceremony, True
Not all these laid in bed majestical, True
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave, True
Who with a body filld and vacant mind, True
Gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread, True
Never sees horrid night the child of hell, True
But like a lackey from the rise to set, True
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night, True
Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn, True
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse, True
And follows so the everrunning year, True
With profitable labour to his grave, True
And but for ceremony such a wretch, True
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, True
Had the forehand and vantage of a king, True
The slave a member of the countrys peace, True
Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots, True
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace, True
Whose hours the peasant best advantages, True
My lord your nobles jealous of your absence, True
Seek through your camp to find you, True
Collect them all together at my tent, True
I shall dot my lord, True

Possess them not with fear take from them now, True
The sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers, True
Pluck their hearts from them Not today O Lord, True
O not today think not upon the fault, True
My father made in compassing the crown, True
I Richards body have interred anew, True
And on it have bestowd more contrite tears, True
Than from it issued forced drops of blood, True
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay, True
Who twice aday their witherd hands hold up, True
Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built, True
Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests, True
Sing still for Richards soul More will I do, True
Though all that I can do is nothing worth, True
Since that my penitence comes after all, True
My brother Gloucesters voice Ay, True
I know thy errand I will go with thee, True
The day my friends and all things stay for me, True

Madam my interpreter what says she, True
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of, True
FranceI cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish, True
Your majesty entendre bettre que moi, True
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss, True
before they are married would she say, True
O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear, True
Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak, True
list of a countrys fashion we are the makers of, True
manners Kate and the liberty that follows our, True
places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I will, True
do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your, True
country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently, True
You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is, True
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the, True
tongues of the French council and they should, True
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general, True
petition of monarchs Here comes your father, True
Reenter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN BURGUNDY and other Lords, True
God save your majesty my royal cousin teach you, True
our princess English, True
I would have her learn my fair cousin how, True
perfectly I love her and that is good English, True
Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not, True
smooth so that having neither the voice nor the, True
heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up, True
the spirit of love in her that he will appear in, True
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you, True
for that If you would conjure in her you must, True
make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true, True
likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you, True
blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the, True
virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the, True
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing, True
self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid, True
Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces, True
They are then excused my lord when they see not, True
Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking, True
I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will, True
teach her to know my meaning for maids well, True
summered and warm kept are like flies at, True
Bartholomewtide blind though they have their, True
eyes and then they will endure handling which, True
before would not abide looking on, True
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer, True
and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the, True
latter end and she must be blind too, True
As love is my lord before it loves, True
It is so and you may some of you thank love for, True
my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city, True
for one fair French maid that stands in my way, True
Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities, True
turned into a maid for they are all girdled with, True
maiden walls that war hath never entered, True
Shall Kate be my wife, True
I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may, True
wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for, True
my wish shall show me the way to my will, True
We have consented to all terms of reason, True
Ist so my lords of England, True
The king hath granted every article, True
His daughter first and then in sequel all, True
According to their firm proposed natures, True
Only he hath not yet subscribed this, True
Where your majesty demands that the King of France, True
having any occasion to write for matter of grant, True
shall name your highness in this form and with this, True
addition in French Notre trescher fils Henri Roi, True
dAngleterre Heritier de France and thus in, True
Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex, True
Angliae et Haeres Franciae, True
Nor this I have not brother so denied, True
But your request shall make me let it pass, True
I pray you then in love and dear alliance, True
Let that one article rank with the rest, True
And thereupon give me your daughter, True
Take her fair son and from her blood raise up, True
Issue to me that the contending kingdoms, True
Of France and England whose very shores look pale, True
With envy of each others happiness, True
May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction, True
Plant neighbourhood and Christianlike accord, True
In their sweet bosoms that never war advance, True
His bleeding sword twixt England and fair France, True
Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all, True
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen, True
God the best maker of all marriages, True
Combine your hearts in one your realms in one, True
As man and wife being two are one in love, True
So be there twixt your kingdoms such a spousal, True
That never may ill office or fell jealousy, True
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage, True
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms, True
To make divorce of their incorporate league, True
That English may as French French Englishmen, True
Receive each other God speak this Amen, True
Prepare we for our marriageon which day, True
My Lord of Burgundy well take your oath, True
And all the peers for surety of our leagues, True
Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me, True
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be, True
Thus far with rough and allunable pen, True
Our bending author hath pursued the story, True
In little room confining mighty men, True
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory, True
Small time but in that small most greatly lived, True
This star of England Fortune made his sword, True
By which the worlds best garden be achieved, True
And of it left his son imperial lord, True
Henry the Sixth in infant bands crownd King, True
Of France and England did this king succeed, True
Whose state so many had the managing, True
That they lost France and made his England bleed, True
Which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake, True
In your fair minds let this acceptance take, True
The Second part of King Henry the Fourth, True
Warkworth Before the castle, True
Enter RUMOUR painted full of tongues, True
Open your ears for which of you will stop, True
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks, True
I from the orient to the drooping west, True
Making the wind my posthorse still unfold, True
The acts commenced on this ball of earth, True
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride, True
The which in every language I pronounce, True
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports, True
I speak of peace while covert enmity, True
Under the smile of safety wounds the world, True
And who but Rumour who but only I, True
Make fearful musters and prepared defence, True
Whiles the big year swoln with some other grief, True
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war, True
And no such matter Rumour is a pipe, True
Blown by surmises jealousies conjectures, True
And of so easy and so plain a stop, True
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads, True
The stilldiscordant wavering multitude, True
Can play upon it But what need I thus, True
My wellknown body to anatomize, True
Among my household Why is Rumour here, True
I run before King Harrys victory, True
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury, True
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops, True
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion, True
Even with the rebels blood But what mean I, True
To speak so true at first my office is, True
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell, True
Under the wrath of noble Hotspurs sword, True
And that the king before the Douglas rage, True
Stoopd his anointed head as low as death, True
This have I rumourd through the peasant towns, True
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury, True
And this wormeaten hold of ragged stone, True
Where Hotspurs father old Northumberland, True
Lies craftysick the posts come tiring on, True
And not a man of them brings other news, True
Than they have learnd of me from Rumours tongues, True
They bring smooth comforts false worse than, True
Who keeps the gate here ho, True
The Porter opens the gate, True
What shall I say you are, True
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here, True
His lordship is walkd forth into the orchard, True
Please it your honour knock but at the gate, True
And he himself wilt answer, True
What news Lord Bardolph every minute now, True
Should be the father of some stratagem, True
The times are wild contention like a horse, True
Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose, True
And bears down all before him, True
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury, True
As good as heart can wish, True
The king is almost wounded to the death, True
And in the fortune of my lord your son, True
Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts, True
Killd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John, True
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field, True
And Harry Monmouths brawn the hulk Sir John, True
Is prisoner to your son O such a day, True
So fought so followd and so fairly won, True
Came not till now to dignify the times, True
Since Caesars fortunes, True
Saw you the field came you from Shrewsbury, True
I spake with one my lord that came from thence, True
A gentleman well bred and of good name, True
That freely renderd me these news for true, True
Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent, True
On Tuesday last to listen after news, True
My lord I overrode him on the way, True
And he is furnishd with no certainties, True
More than he haply may retail from me, True
Now Travers what good tidings comes with you, True
My lord Sir John Umfrevile turnd me back, True
With joyful tidings and being better horsed, True
Outrode me After him came spurring hard, True
A gentleman almost forspent with speed, True
That stoppd by me to breathe his bloodied horse, True
He askd the way to Chester and of him, True
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury, True
He told me that rebellion had bad luck, True
And that young Harry Percys spur was cold, True
With that he gave his able horse the head, True
And bending forward struck his armed heels, True
Against the panting sides of his poor jade, True
Up to the rowelhead and starting so, True
He seemd in running to devour the way, True
Staying no longer question, True
Said he young Harry Percys spur was cold, True
Of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion, True
My lord Ill tell you what, True
If my young lord your son have not the day, True
Upon mine honour for a silken point, True
Ill give my barony never talk of it, True
Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers, True
Give then such instances of loss, True
He was some hilding fellow that had stolen, True
The horse he rode on and upon my life, True
Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news, True
Yea this mans brow like to a titleleaf, True
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume, True
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood, True
Hath left a witnessd usurpation, True
Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury, True
I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord, True
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask, True
How doth my son and brother, True
Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek, True
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand, True
Even such a man so faint so spiritless, True
So dull so dead in look so woebegone, True
Drew Priams curtain in the dead of night, True
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt, True
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, True
And I my Percys death ere thou reportst it, True
This thou wouldst say Your son did thus and thus, True
Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas, True
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds, True
But in the end to stop my ear indeed, True
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, True
Ending with Brother son and all are dead, True
Douglas is living and your brother yet, True
But for my lord your son, True
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath, True
He that but fears the thing he would not know, True
Hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes, True
That what he feard is chanced Yet speak Morton, True
Tell thou an earl his divination lies, True
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace, True
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong, True
You are too great to be by me gainsaid, True
Your spirit is too true your fears too certain, True
Yet for all this say not that Percys dead, True
I see a strange confession in thine eye, True
Thou shakest thy head and holdst it fear or sin, True
To speak a truth If he be slain say so, True
The tongue offends not that reports his death, True
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, True
Not he which says the dead is not alive, True
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news, True
Hath but a losing office and his tongue, True
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell, True
Rememberd tolling a departing friend, True
I cannot think my lord your son is dead, True
I am sorry I should force you to believe, True
That which I would to God I had not seen, True
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, True
Rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed, True
To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down, True
The neverdaunted Percy to the earth, True
From whence with life he never more sprung up, True
In few his death whose spirit lent a fire, True
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp, True
Being bruited once took fire and heat away, True
From the best temperd courage in his troops, True
For from his metal was his party steeld, True
Which once in him abated all the rest, True
Turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead, True
And as the thing thats heavy in itself, True
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed, True
So did our men heavy in Hotspurs loss, True
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear, True
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim, True
Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety, True
Fly from the field Then was the noble Worcester, True
Too soon taen prisoner and that furious Scot, True
The bloody Douglas whose welllabouring sword, True
Had three times slain the appearance of the king, True
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame, True
Of those that turnd their backs and in his flight, True
Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all, True
Is that the king hath won and hath sent out, True
A speedy power to encounter you my lord, True
Under the conduct of young Lancaster, True
And Westmoreland This is the news at full, True
For this I shall have time enough to mourn, True
In poison there is physic and these news, True
Having been well that would have made me sick, True
Being sick have in some measure made me well, True
And as the wretch whose feverweakend joints, True
Like strengthless hinges buckle under life, True
Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire, True
Out of his keepers arms even so my limbs, True
Weakend with grief being now enraged with grief, True
Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch, True
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel, True
Must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif, True
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head, True
Which princes fleshd with conquest aim to hit, True
Now bind my brows with iron and approach, True
The raggedst hour that time and spite dare bring, True
To frown upon the enraged Northumberland, True
Let heaven kiss earth now let not Natures hand, True
Keep the wild flood confined let order die, True
And let this world no longer be a stage, True
To feed contention in a lingering act, True
But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain, True
Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set, True
On bloody courses the rude scene may end, True
And darkness be the burier of the dead, True
This strained passion doth you wrong my lord, True
Sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour, True
The lives of all your loving complices, True
Lean on your health the which if you give oer, True
To stormy passion must perforce decay, True
You cast the event of war my noble lord, True
And summd the account of chance before you said, True
Let us make head It was your presurmise, True
That in the dole of blows your son might drop, True
You knew he walkd oer perils on an edge, True
More likely to fall in than to get oer, True
You were advised his flesh was capable, True
Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit, True
Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged, True
Yet did you say Go forth and none of this, True
Though strongly apprehended could restrain, True
The stiffborne action what hath then befallen, True
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth, True
More than that being which was like to be, True
We all that are engaged to this loss, True
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas, True
That if we wrought our life twas ten to one, True
And yet we ventured for the gain proposed, True
Choked the respect of likely peril feard, True
And since we are oerset venture again, True
Come we will all put forth body and goods, True
Tis more than time and my most noble lord, True
I hear for certain and do speak the truth, True
The gentle Archbishop of York is up, True
With wellappointed powers he is a man, True
Who with a double surety binds his followers, True
My lord your son had only but the corpse, True
But shadows and the shows of men to fight, True
For that same word rebellion did divide, True
The action of their bodies from their souls, True
And they did fight with queasiness constraind, True
As men drink potions that their weapons only, True
Seemd on our side but for their spirits and souls, True
This word rebellion it had froze them up, True
As fish are in a pond But now the bishop, True
Turns insurrection to religion, True
Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts, True
Hes followed both with body and with mind, True
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood, True
Of fair King Richard scraped from Pomfret stones, True
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause, True
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land, True
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke, True
And more and less do flock to follow him, True
I knew of this before but to speak truth, True
This present grief had wiped it from my mind, True
Go in with me and counsel every man, True
The aptest way for safety and revenge, True
Get posts and letters and make friends with speed, True
Never so few and never yet more need, True
SCENE II London A street, True
Enter FALSTAFF with his Page bearing his sword and buckler, True
Sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water, True
He said sir the water itself was a good healthy, True
water but for the party that owed it he might, True
have more diseases than he knew for, True
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the, True
brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not, True

witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other, True
men I do here walk before thee like a sow that, True
hath overwhelmed all her litter but one If the, True
prince put thee into my service for any other reason, True
than to set me off why then I have no judgment, True
Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn, True
in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never, True

send you back again to your master for a jewel, True
the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is, True

not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a, True
faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence, True
out of it and yet hell be crowing as if he had, True

I can assure him What said Master Dombledon about, True
the satin for my short cloak and my slops, True
He said sir you should procure him better, True
assurance than Bardolph he would not take his, True
band and yours he liked not the security, True
Let him be damned like the glutton pray God his, True
tongue be hotter A whoreson Achitophel a rascally, True
yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand, True
and then stand upon security The whoreson, True
smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and, True
bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is, True
through with them in honest taking up then they, True
must stand upon security I had as lief they would, True
put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with, True
security I looked a should have sent me two and, True
twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he, True
sends me security Well he may sleep in security, True
for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness, True
of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he, True
see though he have his own lanthorn to light him, True
Hes gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse, True
I bought him in Pauls and hell buy me a horse in, True

is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, True
were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell, True
Why sir did I say you were an honest man setting, True
my knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied, True
in my throat if I had said so, True
I pray you sir then set your knighthood and our, True
soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you, True

It hath its original from much grief from study and, True

Very well my lord very well rather ant please, True

I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient, True

His effect of gravy gravy gravy, True
Lord ChiefJustice You follow the young prince up and down like his, True
Not so my lord your ill angel is light but I hope, True
he that looks upon me will take me without weighing, True
and yet in some respects I grant I cannot go I, True
cannot tell Virtue is of so little regard in these, True
costermonger times that true valour is turned, True
bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath, True
his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the, True
other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of, True

You that are old consider not the capacities of us, True

livers with the bitterness of your galls and we, True

Lord ChiefJustice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, True

might never spit white again There is not a, True
dangerous action can peep out his head but I am, True
thrust upon it well I cannot last ever but it, True
was alway yet the trick of our English nation if, True
they have a good thing to make it too common If, True
ye will needs say I am an old man you should give, True
me rest I would to God my name were not so, True
terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be, True
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to, True
nothing with perpetual motion, True
Lord ChiefJustice Well be honest be honest and God bless your, True
Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to, True
Lord ChiefJustice Not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to, True
bear crosses Fare you well commend me to my, True
Exeunt ChiefJustice and Servant, True
If I do fillip me with a threeman beetle A man, True
can no more separate age and covetousness than a, True
can part young limbs and lechery but the gout, True
galls the one and the pox pinches the other and, True
so both the degrees prevent my curses Boy, True
What money is in my purse, True
Seven groats and two pence, True
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the, True
purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, True
but the disease is incurable Go bear this letter, True

to the Earl of Westmoreland and this to old, True
Mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry, True

About it you know where to find me, True
A pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for, True
the one or the other plays the rogue with my great, True
toe Tis no matter if I do halt I have the wars, True

SCENE III York The Archbishops palace, True
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK the Lords HASTINGS MOWBRAY and BARDOLPH, True
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means, True
And my most noble friends I pray you all, True
Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes, True
And first lord marshal what say you to it, True
I well allow the occasion of our arms, True
But gladly would be better satisfied, True
How in our means we should advance ourselves, True
To look with forehead bold and big enough, True
Upon the power and puissance of the king, True
Our present musters grow upon the file, True
To five and twenty thousand men of choice, True
And our supplies live largely in the hope, True
Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns, True
With an incensed fire of injuries, True
The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus, True
Whether our present five and twenty thousand, True
May hold up head without Northumberland, True
Yea marry theres the point, True
But if without him we be thought too feeble, True
My judgment is we should not step too far, True
Till we had his assistance by the hand, True
For in a theme so bloodyfaced as this, True
Conjecture expectation and surmise, True
Of aids incertain should not be admitted, True
Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed, True
It was young Hotspurs case at Shrewsbury, True
It was my lord who lined himself with hope, True
Eating the air on promise of supply, True
Flattering himself in project of a power, True
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts, True
And so with great imagination, True
Proper to madmen led his powers to death, True
And winking leapd into destruction, True
But by your leave it never yet did hurt, True
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope, True
Yes if this present quality of war, True
Indeed the instant action a cause on foot, True
Lives so in hope as in an early spring, True
We see the appearing buds which to prove fruit, True
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair, True
That frosts will bite them When we mean to build, True
We first survey the plot then draw the model, True
And when we see the figure of the house, True
Then must we rate the cost of the erection, True
Which if we find outweighs ability, True
What do we then but draw anew the model, True
In fewer offices or at last desist, True
To build at all Much more in this great work, True
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down, True
And set another up should we survey, True
The plot of situation and the model, True
Consent upon a sure foundation, True
Question surveyors know our own estate, True
How able such a work to undergo, True
To weigh against his opposite or else, True
We fortify in paper and in figures, True
Using the names of men instead of men, True
Like one that draws the model of a house, True
Beyond his power to build it who half through, True
Gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost, True
A naked subject to the weeping clouds, True
And waste for churlish winters tyranny, True
Grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth, True
Should be stillborn and that we now possessd, True
The utmost man of expectation, True
I think we are a body strong enough, True
Even as we are to equal with the king, True
What is the king but five and twenty thousand, True
To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph, True
For his divisions as the times do brawl, True
Are in three heads one power against the French, True
And one against Glendower perforce a third, True
Must take up us so is the unfirm king, True
In three divided and his coffers sound, True
With hollow poverty and emptiness, True
That he should draw his several strengths together, True
And come against us in full puissance, True
He leaves his back unarmd the French and Welsh, True
Baying him at the heels never fear that, True
Who is it like should lead his forces hither, True
The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland, True
Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth, True
But who is substituted gainst the French, True
I have no certain notice, True
And publish the occasion of our arms, True
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice, True
Their overgreedy love hath surfeited, True
An habitation giddy and unsure, True
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart, True
O thou fond many with what loud applause, True
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke, True
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be, True
And being now trimmd in thine own desires, True
Thou beastly feeder art so full of him, True
That thou provokest thyself to cast him up, True
So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge, True
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard, True
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up, True
And howlst to find it What trust is in, True
They that when Richard lived would have him die, True
Are now become enamourd on his grave, True
Thou that threwst dust upon his goodly head, True
When through proud London he came sighing on, True
After the admired heels of Bolingbroke, True
Criest now O earth yield us that king again, True
And take thou this O thoughts of men accursed, True
Past and to come seems best things present worst, True
Shall we go draw our numbers and set on, True
We are times subjects and time bids be gone, True

Why a prince should not be so loosely studied as, True
to remember so weak a composition, True
Belike then my appetite was not princely got for, True
by my troth I do now remember the poor creature, True
small beer But indeed these humble, True
considerations make me out of love with my, True
greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember, True
thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to, True
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou, True
hast viz these and those that were thy, True
peachcoloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy, True
shirts as one for superfluity and another for, True
use But that the tenniscourtkeeper knows better, True
than I for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when, True
thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done, True
a great while because the rest of thy low, True
countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland, True
and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins, True
of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the, True
midwives say the children are not in the fault, True
whereupon the world increases and kindreds are, True
mightily strengthened, True
How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard, True

Very hardly upon such a subject, True
By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devils, True
book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and, True
persistency let the end try the man But I tell, True
thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so, True
sick and keeping such vile company as thou art, True
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow, True
What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep, True
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite, True
It would be every mans thought and thou art a, True
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never, True
a mans thought in the world keeps the roadway, True
better than thine every man would think me an, True
hypocrite indeed And what accites your most, True
worshipful thought to think so, True
Why because you have been so lewd and so much, True
engraffed to Falstaff, True
By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it, True
with my own ears the worst that they can say of, True

And speaking thick which nature made his blemish, True
Became the accents of the valiant, True
For those that could speak low and tardily, True

Than in the perfumed chambers of the great, True
Under the canopies of costly state, True
And lulld with sound of sweetest melody, True
O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile, True
In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch, True

Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast, True
Seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains, True
In cradle of the rude imperious surge, True

Which to his former strength may be restored, True
With good advice and little medicine, True
My Lord Northumberland will soon be coold, True

With a near aim of the main chance of things, True
As yet not come to life which in their seeds, True
And weak beginnings lie intreasured, True
Such things become the hatch and brood of time, True
And by the necessary form of this, True
King Richard might create a perfect guess, True
That great Northumberland then false to him, True
Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness, True
Which should not find a ground to root upon, True
Are these things then necessities, True
Then let us meet them like necessities, True
And that same word even now cries out on us, True

subject we old men are to this vice of lying This, True
same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to, True
me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he, True
hath done about Turnbull Street and every third, True
word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turks, True
tribute I do remember him at Clements Inn like a, True
man made after supper of a cheeseparing when a, True
was naked he was for all the world like a forked, True
radish with a head fantastically carved upon it, True
with a knife a was so forlorn that his, True
dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a, True
was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a, True
monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came, True
ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those, True
tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the, True
carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or, True
his goodnights And now is this Vices dagger, True
become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a, True
Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and, True
Ill be sworn a neer saw him but once in the, True
Tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding, True
among the marshals men I saw it and told John a, True
Gaunt he beat his own name for you might have, True
thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the, True
case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a, True
court and now has he land and beefs Well Ill, True
be acquainted with him if I return and it shall, True
go hard but I will make him a philosophers two, True
stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the, True
old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I, True
may snap at him Let time shape and there an end, True
SCENE I Yorkshire Gaultree Forest, True
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK MOWBRAY LORD HASTINGS and others, True
What is this forest calld, True
Tis Gaultree Forest ant shall please your grace, True
Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth, True
To know the numbers of our enemies, True
We have sent forth already, True
My friends and brethren in these great affairs, True
I must acquaint you that I have received, True
Newdated letters from Northumberland, True
Their cold intent tenor and substance thus, True
Here doth he wish his person with such powers, True
As might hold sortance with his quality, True
The which he could not levy whereupon, True
He is retired to ripe his growing fortunes, True
To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers, True
That your attempts may overlive the hazard, True
And fearful melting of their opposite, True
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground, True
And dash themselves to pieces, True
West of this forest scarcely off a mile, True
In goodly form comes on the enemy, True
And by the ground they hide I judge their number, True
Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand, True
The just proportion that we gave them out, True
Let us sway on and face them in the field, True
What wellappointed leader fronts us here, True
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland, True
Health and fair greeting from our general, True
The prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster, True
Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace, True
What doth concern your coming, True
Unto your grace do I in chief address, True
The substance of my speech If that rebellion, True
Came like itself in base and abject routs, True
Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags, True
And countenanced by boys and beggary, True
I say if damnd commotion so appeard, True
In his true native and most proper shape, True
You reverend father and these noble lords, True
Had not been here to dress the ugly form, True
Of base and bloody insurrection, True
With your fair honours You lord archbishop, True
Whose see is by a civil peace maintained, True
Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd, True
Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord, True
Whose white investments figure innocence, True
The dove and very blessed spirit of peace, True
Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself, True
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace, True
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war, True
Turning your books to graves your ink to blood, True
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine, True
To a trumpet and a point of war, True
Wherefore do I this so the question stands, True
Briefly to this end we are all diseased, True
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours, True
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever, True
And we must bleed for it of which disease, True
Our late king Richard being infected died, True
But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland, True
I take not on me here as a physician, True
Nor do I as an enemy to peace, True
Troop in the throngs of military men, True
But rather show awhile like fearful war, True
To diet rank minds sick of happiness, True
And purge the obstructions which begin to stop, True
Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly, True
I have in equal balance justly weighd, True
What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer, True
And find our griefs heavier than our offences, True
We see which way the stream of time doth run, True
And are enforced from our most quiet there, True
By the rough torrent of occasion, True
And have the summary of all our griefs, True
When time shall serve to show in articles, True
Which long ere this we offerd to the king, True
And might by no suit gain our audience, True
When we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs, True
We are denied access unto his person, True
Even by those men that most have done us wrong, True
The dangers of the days but newly gone, True
Whose memory is written on the earth, True
With yet appearing blood and the examples, True
Of every minutes instance present now, True
Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms, True
Not to break peace or any branch of it, True
But to establish here a peace indeed, True
Concurring both in name and quality, True
When ever yet was your appeal denied, True
Wherein have you been galled by the king, True
What peer hath been subornd to grate on you, True
That you should seal this lawless bloody book, True
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine, True
And consecrate commotions bitter edge, True
My brother general the commonwealth, True
To brother born an household cruelty, True
I make my quarrel in particular, True
There is no need of any such redress, True
Or if there were it not belongs to you, True
Why not to him in part and to us all, True
That feel the bruises of the days before, True
And suffer the condition of these times, True
To lay a heavy and unequal hand, True
O my good Lord Mowbray, True
Construe the times to their necessities, True
And you shall say indeed it is the time, True
And not the king that doth you injuries, True
Yet for your part it not appears to me, True
Either from the king or in the present time, True
That you should have an inch of any ground, True
To build a grief on were you not restored, True
To all the Duke of Norfolks signories, True
Your noble and right well rememberd fathers, True
What thing in honour had my father lost, True
That need to be revived and breathed in me, True
The king that loved him as the state stood then, True
Was force perforce compelld to banish him, True
And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he, True
Being mounted and both roused in their seats, True
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur, True
Their armed staves in charge their beavers down, True
Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel, True
And the loud trumpet blowing them together, True
Then then when there was nothing could have stayd, True
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, True
O when the king did throw his warder down, True
His own life hung upon the staff he threw, True
Then threw he down himself and all their lives, True
That by indictment and by dint of sword, True
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke, True
You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what, True
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then, True
In England the most valiant gentlemen, True
Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled, True
But if your father had been victor there, True
He neer had borne it out of Coventry, True
For all the country in a general voice, True
Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love, True
Were set on Hereford whom they doted on, True
And blessd and graced indeed more than the king, True
But this is mere digression from my purpose, True
Here come I from our princely general, True
To know your griefs to tell you from his grace, True
That he will give you audience and wherein, True
It shall appear that your demands are just, True
You shall enjoy them every thing set off, True
That might so much as think you enemies, True
But he hath forced us to compel this offer, True
And it proceeds from policy not love, True
Mowbray you overween to take it so, True
This offer comes from mercy not from fear, True
For lo within a ken our army lies, True
Upon mine honour all too confident, True
To give admittance to a thought of fear, True
Our battle is more full of names than yours, True
Our men more perfect in the use of arms, True
Our armour all as strong our cause the best, True
Then reason will our heart should be as good, True
Say you not then our offer is compelld, True
Well by my will we shall admit no parley, True
That argues but the shame of your offence, True
A rotten case abides no handling, True
Hath the Prince John a full commission, True
In very ample virtue of his father, True
To hear and absolutely to determine, True
Of what conditions we shall stand upon, True
That is intended in the generals name, True
I muse you make so slight a question, True
Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule, True
For this contains our general grievances, True
Each several article herein redressd, True
All members of our cause both here and hence, True
That are insinewd to this action, True
Acquitted by a true substantial form, True
And present execution of our wills, True
To us and to our purposes confined, True
We come within our awful banks again, True
And knit our powers to the arm of peace, True
This will I show the general Please you lords, True
In sight of both our battles we may meet, True
And either end in peace which God so frame, True
Or to the place of difference call the swords, True
Which must decide it, True
My lord we will do so, True
There is a thing within my bosom tells me, True
That no conditions of our peace can stand, True
Fear you not that if we can make our peace, True
Upon such large terms and so absolute, True
As our conditions shall consist upon, True
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains, True
Yea but our valuation shall be such, True
That every slight and falsederived cause, True
Yea every idle nice and wanton reason, True
Shall to the king taste of this action, True
That were our royal faiths martyrs in love, True
We shall be winnowd with so rough a wind, True
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff, True
And good from bad find no partition, True
No no my lord Note this the king is weary, True
Of dainty and such picking grievances, True
For he hath found to end one doubt by death, True
Revives two greater in the heirs of life, True
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean, True
And keep no telltale to his memory, True
That may repeat and history his loss, True
To new remembrance for full well he knows, True
He cannot so precisely weed this land, True
As his misdoubts present occasion, True
His foes are so enrooted with his friends, True
That plucking to unfix an enemy, True
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend, True
So that this land like an offensive wife, True
That hath enraged him on to offer strokes, True
As he is striking holds his infant up, True
And hangs resolved correction in the arm, True
That was upreard to execution, True
Besides the king hath wasted all his rods, True
On late offenders that he now doth lack, True
The very instruments of chastisement, True
So that his power like to a fangless lion, True
May offer but not hold, True
And therefore be assured my good lord marshal, True
If we do now make our atonement well, True
Our peace will like a broken limb united, True
Grow stronger for the breaking, True
Here is returnd my Lord of Westmoreland, True
Reenter WESTMORELAND, True
The prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship, True
To meet his grace just distance tween our armies, True
Your grace of York in Gods name then set forward, True
Before and greet his grace my lord we come, True
SCENE II Another part of the forest, True
Enter from one side MOWBRAY attended afterwards the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK HASTINGS and others from the other side Prince John of LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND Officers and others with them, True
You are well encounterd here my cousin Mowbray, True
Good day to you gentle lord archbishop, True
And so to you Lord Hastings and to all, True
My Lord of York it better showd with you, True
When that your flock assembled by the bell, True
Encircled you to hear with reverence, True
Your exposition on the holy text, True
Than now to see you here an iron man, True
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum, True
Turning the word to sword and life to death, True
That man that sits within a monarchs heart, True
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour, True
Would he abuse the countenance of the king, True
Alack what mischiefs might he set abrooch, True
In shadow of such greatness With you lord bishop, True
It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken, True
How deep you were within the books of God, True
To us the speaker in his parliament, True
To us the imagined voice of God himself, True
The very opener and intelligencer, True
Between the grace the sanctities of heaven, True
And our dull workings O who shall believe, True
But you misuse the reverence of your place, True
Employ the countenance and grace of heaven, True
As a false favourite doth his princes name, True
In deeds dishonourable You have taen up, True
Under the counterfeited zeal of God, True
The subjects of his substitute my father, True
And both against the peace of heaven and him, True
Have here upswarmd them, True
Good my Lord of Lancaster, True
I am not here against your fathers peace, True
But as I told my lord of Westmoreland, True
The time misorderd doth in common sense, True
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form, True
To hold our safety up I sent your grace, True
The parcels and particulars of our grief, True
The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court, True
Whereon this Hydra son of war is born, True
Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmd asleep, True
With grant of our most just and right desires, True
And true obedience of this madness cured, True
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty, True
If not we ready are to try our fortunes, True
And though we here fall down, True
We have supplies to second our attempt, True
If they miscarry theirs shall second them, True
And so success of mischief shall be born, True
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up, True
Whiles England shall have generation, True
You are too shallow Hastings much too shallow, True
To sound the bottom of the aftertimes, True
Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly, True
How far forth you do like their articles, True
I like them all and do allow them well, True
And swear here by the honour of my blood, True
My fathers purposes have been mistook, True
And some about him have too lavishly, True
Wrested his meaning and authority, True
My lord these griefs shall be with speed redressd, True
Upon my soul they shall If this may please you, True
Discharge your powers unto their several counties, True
As we will ours and here between the armies, True
Lets drink together friendly and embrace, True
That all their eyes may bear those tokens home, True
Of our restored love and amity, True
I take your princely word for these redresses, True
I give it you and will maintain my word, True
And thereupon I drink unto your grace, True
Go captain and deliver to the army, True
This news of peace let them have pay and part, True
I know it will well please them Hie thee captain, True
To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland, True
I pledge your grace and if you knew what pains, True
I have bestowd to breed this present peace, True
You would drink freely but my love to ye, True
Shall show itself more openly hereafter, True
Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray, True
You wish me health in very happy season, True
For I am on the sudden something ill, True
Against ill chances men are ever merry, True
But heaviness foreruns the good event, True
Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow, True
Serves to say thus some good thing comes, True
Believe me I am passing light in spirit, True
So much the worse if your own rule be true, True
The word of peace is renderd hark how they shout, True
This had been cheerful after victory, True
A peace is of the nature of a conquest, True
For then both parties nobly are subdued, True
And neither party loser, True
And let our army be discharged too, True
And good my lord so please you let our trains, True
March by us that we may peruse the men, True
We should have coped withal, True
Go good Lord Hastings, True
And ere they be dismissed let them march by, True
I trust lords we shall lie tonight together, True
Reenter WESTMORELAND, True
Now cousin wherefore stands our army still, True
The leaders having charge from you to stand, True
Will not go off until they hear you speak, True
They know their duties, True
My lord our army is dispersed already, True
Like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses, True
East west north south or like a school broke up, True
Each hurries toward his home and sportingplace, True
Good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which, True
I do arrest thee traitor of high treason, True
And you lord archbishop and you Lord Mowbray, True
Of capitol treason I attach you both, True
Is this proceeding just and honourable, True
Will you thus break your faith, True
I promised you redress of these same grievances, True
Whereof you did complain which by mine honour, True
I will perform with a most Christian care, True
But for you rebels look to taste the due, True
Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours, True
Most shallowly did you these arms commence, True
Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence, True
Strike up our drums pursue the scatterd stray, True
God and not we hath safely fought today, True
Some guard these traitors to the block of death, True
Treasons true bed and yielder up of breath, True
SCENE III Another part of the forest, True

I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of, True

One time or other break some gallows back, True
I would be sorry my lord but it should be thus I, True
never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward, True
of valour Do you think me a swallow an arrow or a, True
bullet have I in my poor and old motion the, True
expedition of thought I have speeded hither with, True

foundered nine score and odd posts and here, True
traveltainted as I am have in my pure and, True
immaculate valour taken Sir John Colevile of the, True

But what of that he saw me and yielded that I, True
may justly say with the hooknosed fellow of Rome, True
I came saw and overcame, True
It was more of his courtesy than your deserving, True
I know not here he is and here I yield him and, True
I beseech your grace let it be booked with the, True
rest of this days deeds or by the Lord I will, True

Thines too heavy to mount, True
Thines too thick to shine, True

A famous rebel art thou Colevile, True
And a famous true subject took him, True

Theres never none of these demure boys come to any, True
proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood, True
and making many fishmeals that they fall into a, True
kind of male greensickness and then when they, True
marry they get wenches they are generally fools, True
and cowards which some of us should be too but for, True
inflammation A good sherris sack hath a twofold, True
operation in it It ascends me into the brain, True
dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy, True
vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive, True
quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and, True
delectable shapes which delivered oer to the, True
voice the tongue which is the birth becomes, True
excellent wit The second property of your, True
excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, True
which before cold and settled left the liver, True
white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity, True
and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes, True
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme, True
it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives, True
warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, True
man to arm and then the vital commoners and, True
inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, True
the heart who great and puffed up with this, True
retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour, True
comes of sherris So that skill in the weapon is, True
nothing without sack for that sets it awork and, True
learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till, True
sack commences it and sets it in act and use, True
Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant for, True
the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his, True
father he hath like lean sterile and bare land, True
manured husbanded and tilled with excellent, True
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile, True
sherris that he is become very hot and valiant If, True
I had a thousand sons the first humane principle I, True
would teach them should be to forswear thin, True
potations and to addict themselves to sack, True
The army is discharged all and gone, True
Let them go Ill through Gloucestershire and, True
there will I visit Master Robert Shallow esquire, True

Now lords if God doth give successful end, True
To this debate that bleedeth at our doors, True
We will our youth lead on to higher fields, True
And draw no swords but what are sanctified, True
Our navy is addressd our power collected, True
Our substitutes in absence well invested, True
And every thing lies level to our wish, True
Only we want a little personal strength, True
And pause us till these rebels now afoot, True
Come underneath the yoke of government, True
Both which we doubt not but your majesty, True
Humphrey my son of Gloucester, True
Where is the prince your brother, True
I think hes gone to hunt my lord at Windsor, True
I do not know my lord, True
Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him, True
No my good lord he is in presence here, True
What would my lord and father, True
Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence, True
How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother, True
He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas, True
Thou hast a better place in his affection, True
Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy, True
And noble offices thou mayst effect, True
Of mediation after I am dead, True
Between his greatness and thy other brethren, True
Therefore omit him not blunt not his love, True
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace, True
By seeming cold or careless of his will, True
For he is gracious if he be observed, True
He hath a tear for pity and a hand, True
Open as day for melting charity, True
Yet notwithstanding being incensed hes flint, True
As humorous as winter and as sudden, True
As flaws congealed in the spring of day, True
His temper therefore must be well observed, True
Chide him for faults and do it reverently, True
When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth, True
But being moody give him line and scope, True
Till that his passions like a whale on ground, True
Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas, True
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends, True
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in, True
That the united vessel of their blood, True
Mingled with venom of suggestion, True
As force perforce the age will pour it in, True
Shall never leak though it do work as strong, True
As aconitum or rash gunpowder, True
I shall observe him with all care and love, True
Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas, True
He is not there today he dines in London, True
And how accompanied canst thou tell that, True
With Poins and other his continual followers, True
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds, True
And he the noble image of my youth, True
Is overspread with them therefore my grief, True
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death, True
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape, True
In forms imaginary the unguided days, True
And rotten times that you shall look upon, True
When I am sleeping with my ancestors, True
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb, True
When rage and hot blood are his counsellors, True
When means and lavish manners meet together, True
O with what wings shall his affections fly, True
Towards fronting peril and opposed decay, True
My gracious lord you look beyond him quite, True
The prince but studies his companions, True
Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language, True
Tis needful that the most immodest word, True
Be lookd upon and learnd which once attaind, True
Your highness knows comes to no further use, True
But to be known and hated So like gross terms, True
The prince will in the perfectness of time, True
Cast off his followers and their memory, True
Shall as a pattern or a measure live, True
By which his grace must mete the lives of others, True
Turning past evils to advantages, True
Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb, True
Whos here Westmoreland, True
Health to my sovereign and new happiness, True
Added to that that I am to deliver, True
Prince John your son doth kiss your graces hand, True
Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all, True
Are brought to the correction of your law, True
There is not now a rebels sword unsheathd, True
But peace puts forth her olive every where, True
The manner how this action hath been borne, True
Here at more leisure may your highness read, True
With every course in his particular, True
O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird, True
Which ever in the haunch of winter sings, True
The lifting up of day, True
Look heres more news, True
From enemies heaven keep your majesty, True
And when they stand against you may they fall, True
As those that I am come to tell you of, True
The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph, True
With a great power of English and of Scots, True
Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown, True
The manner and true order of the fight, True
This packet please it you contains at large, True
And wherefore should these good news make me sick, True
Will fortune never come with both hands full, True
But write her fair words still in foulest letters, True
She either gives a stomach and no food, True
Such are the poor in health or else a feast, True
And takes away the stomach such are the rich, True
That have abundance and enjoy it not, True
I should rejoice now at this happy news, True
And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy, True
O me come near me now I am much ill, True
Comfort your majesty, True
My sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up, True
Be patient princes you do know these fits, True
Are with his highness very ordinary, True
Stand from him Give him air hell straight be well, True
No no he cannot long hold out these pangs, True
The incessant care and labour of his mind, True
Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in, True
So thin that life looks through and will break out, True
The people fear me for they do observe, True
Unfatherd heirs and loathly births of nature, True
The seasons change their manners as the year, True
Had found some months asleep and leapd them over, True
The river hath thrice flowd no ebb between, True
And the old folk times doting chronicles, True
Say it did so a little time before, True
That our greatgrandsire Edward sickd and died, True
Speak lower princes for the king recovers, True
This apoplexy will certain be his end, True
I pray you take me up and bear me hence, True
Into some other chamber softly pray, True

Let there be no noise made my gentle friends, True
Unless some dull and favourable hand, True
Will whisper music to my weary spirit, True
Call for the music in the other room, True
Set me the crown upon my pillow here, True
His eye is hollow and he changes much, True
Less noise less noise, True
Who saw the Duke of Clarence, True
I am here brother full of heaviness, True

Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY, True
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow, True
Being so troublesome a bedfellow, True
O polishd perturbation golden care, True
That keepst the ports of slumber open wide, True
To many a watchful night sleep with it now, True
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet, True
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound, True
Snores out the watch of night O majesty, True
When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit, True
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day, True
That scalds with safety By his gates of breath, True
There lies a downy feather which stirs not, True
Did he suspire that light and weightless down, True
Perforce must move My gracious lord my father, True
This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep, True
That from this golden rigol hath divorced, True
So many English kings Thy due from me, True
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood, True
Which nature love and filial tenderness, True
Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously, True
My due from thee is this imperial crown, True
Which as immediate as thy place and blood, True
Derives itself to me Lo here it sits, True
Which God shall guard and put the worlds whole strength, True
Into one giant arm it shall not force, True
This lineal honour from me this from thee, True
Will I to mine leave as tis left to me, True
Warwick Gloucester Clarence, True
Reenter WARWICK GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and the rest, True
What would your majesty How fares your grace, True
Why did you leave me here alone my lords, True
We left the prince my brother here my liege, True
Who undertook to sit and watch by you, True
The Prince of Wales Where is he let me see him, True
This door is open he is gone this way, True
He came not through the chamber where we stayd, True
Where is the crown who took it from my pillow, True
When we withdrew my liege we left it here, True
The prince hath taen it hence go seek him out, True
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose, True
Find him my Lord of Warwick chide him hither, True
This part of his conjoins with my disease, True
And helps to end me See sons what things you are, True
How quickly nature falls into revolt, True
When gold becomes her object, True
For this the foolish overcareful fathers, True
Have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care, True
Their bones with industry, True
For this they have engrossed and piled up, True
The cankerd heaps of strangeachieved gold, True
For this they have been thoughtful to invest, True
Their sons with arts and martial exercises, True
When like the bee culling from every flower, True
Our thighs packd with wax our mouths with honey, True
We bring it to the hive and like the bees, True
Are murdered for our pains This bitter taste, True
Yield his engrossments to the ending father, True
Now where is he that will not stay so long, True
Till his friend sickness hath determined me, True
My lord I found the prince in the next room, True
Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks, True
With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow, True
That tyranny which never quaffd but blood, True
Would by beholding him have washd his knife, True
With gentle eyedrops He is coming hither, True
But wherefore did he take away the crown, True
Reenter PRINCE HENRY, True
Lo where he comes Come hither to me Harry, True
Depart the chamber leave us here alone, True
Exeunt WARWICK and the rest, True
I never thought to hear you speak again, True
Thy wish was father Harry to that thought, True
I stay too long by thee I weary thee, True
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair, True
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours, True
Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth, True
Thou seekst the greatness that will oerwhelm thee, True
Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity, True
Is held from falling with so weak a wind, True
That it will quickly drop my day is dim, True
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours, True
Were thine without offence and at my death, True
Thou hast seald up my expectation, True
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not, True
And thou wilt have me die assured of it, True
Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts, True
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart, True
To stab at half an hour of my life, True
What canst thou not forbear me half an hour, True
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself, True
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear, True
That thou art crowned not that I am dead, True
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse, True
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head, True
Only compound me with forgotten dust, True
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms, True
Pluck down my officers break my decrees, True
For now a time is come to mock at form, True
Harry the Fifth is crownd up vanity, True
Down royal state all you sage counsellors hence, True
And to the English court assemble now, True
From every region apes of idleness, True
Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum, True
Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance, True
Revel the night rob murder and commit, True
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways, True
Be happy he will trouble you no more, True
England shall double gild his treble guilt, True
England shall give him office honour might, True
For the fifth Harry from curbd licence plucks, True
The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog, True
Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent, True
O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows, True
When that my care could not withhold thy riots, True
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care, True
O thou wilt be a wilderness again, True
Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants, True
O pardon me my liege but for my tears, True
The moist impediments unto my speech, True
I had forestalld this dear and deep rebuke, True
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard, True
The course of it so far There is your crown, True
And He that wears the crown immortally, True
Long guard it yours If I affect it more, True
Than as your honour and as your renown, True
Let me no more from this obedience rise, True
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit, True
Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending, True
God witness with me when I here came in, True
And found no course of breath within your majesty, True
How cold it struck my heart If I do feign, True
O let me in my present wildness die, True
And never live to show the incredulous world, True
The noble change that I have purposed, True
Coming to look on you thinking you dead, True
And dead almost my liege to think you were, True
I spake unto this crown as having sense, True
And thus upbraided it The care on thee depending, True
Hath fed upon the body of my father, True
Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold, True
Other less fine in carat is more precious, True
Preserving life in medicine potable, True
But thou most fine most honourd most renownd, True
Hast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege, True
Accusing it I put it on my head, True
To try with it as with an enemy, True
That had before my face murderd my father, True
The quarrel of a true inheritor, True
But if it did infect my blood with joy, True
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride, True
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine, True
Did with the least affection of a welcome, True
Give entertainment to the might of it, True
Let God for ever keep it from my head, True
And make me as the poorest vassal is, True
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it, True
God put it in thy mind to take it hence, True
That thou mightst win the more thy fathers love, True
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it, True
Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed, True
And hear I think the very latest counsel, True
That ever I shall breathe God knows my son, True
By what bypaths and indirect crookd ways, True
I met this crown and I myself know well, True
How troublesome it sat upon my head, True
To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet, True
Better opinion better confirmation, True
For all the soil of the achievement goes, True
With me into the earth It seemd in me, True
But as an honour snatchd with boisterous hand, True
And I had many living to upbraid, True
My gain of it by their assistances, True
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed, True
Wounding supposed peace all these bold fears, True
Thou seest with peril I have answered, True
For all my reign hath been but as a scene, True
Acting that argument and now my death, True
Changes the mode for what in me was purchased, True
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort, True
So thou the garland wearst successively, True
Yet though thou standst more sure than I could do, True
Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green, True
And all my friends which thou must make thy friends, True
Have but their stings and teeth newly taen out, True
By whose fell working I was first advanced, True
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear, True
To be again displaced which to avoid, True
I cut them off and had a purpose now, True
To lead out many to the Holy Land, True
Lest rest and lying still might make them look, True
Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry, True
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds, True
With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out, True
May waste the memory of the former days, True
More would I but my lungs are wasted so, True
That strength of speech is utterly denied me, True
How I came by the crown O God forgive, True
And grant it may with thee in true peace live, True
You won it wore it kept it gave it me, True
Then plain and right must my possession be, True
Which I with more than with a common pain, True
Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain, True
Enter Lord John of LANCASTER, True
Look look here comes my John of Lancaster, True
Health peace and happiness to my royal father, True
Thou bringst me happiness and peace son John, True
But health alack with youthful wings is flown, True
From this bare witherd trunk upon thy sight, True
My worldly business makes a period, True

semblable coherence of his mens spirits and his, True
they by observing of him do bear themselves like, True
foolish justices he by conversing with them is, True
turned into a justicelike servingman their, True
spirits are so married in conjunction with the, True
participation of society that they flock together in, True
consent like so many wildgeese If I had a suit, True
to Master Shallow I would humour his men with the, True
imputation of being near their master if to his, True
men I would curry with Master Shallow that no man, True
could better command his servants It is certain, True

To have a son set your decrees at nought, True
To pluck down justice from your awful bench, True

My father is gone wild into his grave, True
For in his tomb lie my affections, True

Enter KING HENRY LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER the EARL of WESTMORELAND SIR WALTER BLUNT and others, True
So shaken as we are so wan with care, True
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant, True
And breathe shortwinded accents of new broils, True
To be commenced in strands afar remote, True
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil, True
Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood, True
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields, True
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs, True
Of hostile paces those opposed eyes, True
Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven, True
All of one nature of one substance bred, True
Did lately meet in the intestine shock, True
And furious close of civil butchery, True
Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks, True
March all one way and be no more opposed, True
Against acquaintance kindred and allies, True
The edge of war like an illsheathed knife, True
No more shall cut his master Therefore friends, True
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, True
Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross, True
We are impressed and engaged to fight, True
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy, True
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb, True
To chase these pagans in those holy fields, True
Over whose acres walkd those blessed feet, True
Which fourteen hundred years ago were naild, True
For our advantage on the bitter cross, True
But this our purpose now is twelve month old, True
And bootless tis to tell you we will go, True
Therefore we meet not now Then let me hear, True
Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland, True
What yesternight our council did decree, True
In forwarding this dear expedience, True
My liege this haste was hot in question, True
And many limits of the charge set down, True
But yesternight when all athwart there came, True
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news, True
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer, True
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight, True
Against the irregular and wild Glendower, True
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken, True
A thousand of his people butchered, True
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse, True
Such beastly shameless transformation, True
By those Welshwomen done as may not be, True
Without much shame retold or spoken of, True
It seems then that the tidings of this broil, True
Brake off our business for the Holy Land, True
This matchd with other did my gracious lord, True
For more uneven and unwelcome news, True
Came from the north and thus it did import, True
On Holyrood day the gallant Hotspur there, True
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald, True
That evervaliant and approved Scot, True
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour, True
As by discharge of their artillery, True
And shape of likelihood the news was told, True
For he that brought them in the very heat, True
And pride of their contention did take horse, True
Uncertain of the issue any way, True
Here is a dear a true industrious friend, True
Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse, True
Staind with the variation of each soil, True
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours, True
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news, True
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited, True
Ten thousand bold Scots two and twenty knights, True
Balkd in their own blood did Sir Walter see, True
On Holmedons plains Of prisoners Hotspur took, True
Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son, True
To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol, True
Of Murray Angus and Menteith, True
And is not this an honourable spoil, True
A gallant prize ha cousin is it not, True
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of, True
Yea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin, True
In envy that my Lord Northumberland, True
Should be the father to so blest a son, True
A son who is the theme of honours tongue, True
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant, True
Who is sweet Fortunes minion and her pride, True
Whilst I by looking on the praise of him, True
See riot and dishonour stain the brow, True
Of my young Harry O that it could be proved, True
That some nighttripping fairy had exchanged, True
In cradleclothes our children where they lay, True
And calld mine Percy his Plantagenet, True
Then would I have his Harry and he mine, True
But let him from my thoughts What think you coz, True
Of this young Percys pride the prisoners, True
Which he in this adventure hath surprised, True
To his own use he keeps and sends me word, True
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife, True
This is his uncles teaching this is Worcester, True
Malevolent to you in all aspects, True
Which makes him prune himself and bristle up, True
The crest of youth against your dignity, True
But I have sent for him to answer this, True
And for this cause awhile we must neglect, True
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem, True
Cousin on Wednesday next our council we, True
Will hold at Windsor so inform the lords, True
But come yourself with speed to us again, True
For more is to be said and to be done, True
Than out of anger can be uttered, True

move and what he hears may be believed that the, True
true prince may for recreation sake prove a false, True
thief for the poor abuses of the time want, True
countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap, True
Farewell thou latter spring farewell Allhallown summer, True
Now my good sweet honey lord ride with us, True
tomorrow I have a jest to execute that I cannot, True
manage alone Falstaff Bardolph Peto and Gadshill, True
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid, True
yourself and I will not be there and when they, True
have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut, True
this head off from my shoulders, True
How shall we part with them in setting forth, True
Why we will set forth before or after them and, True
appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at, True
our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure, True
upon the exploit themselves which they shall have, True
no sooner achieved but well set upon them, True
Yea but tis like that they will know us by our, True
horses by our habits and by every other, True
appointment to be ourselves, True
Tut our horses they shall not see Ill tie them, True
in the wood our vizards we will change after we, True
leave them and sirrah I have cases of buckram, True
for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments, True
Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us, True
Well for two of them I know them to be as, True
truebred cowards as ever turned back and for the, True
third if he fight longer than he sees reason Ill, True
forswear arms The virtue of this jest will be the, True
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will, True
tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at, True
least he fought with what wards what blows what, True
extremities he endured and in the reproof of this, True
Well Ill go with thee provide us all things, True
necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap, True
there Ill sup Farewell, True
I know you all and will awhile uphold, True
The unyoked humour of your idleness, True
Yet herein will I imitate the sun, True
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds, True
To smother up his beauty from the world, True
That when he please again to be himself, True
Being wanted he may be more wonderd at, True
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists, True
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him, True
If all the year were playing holidays, True
To sport would be as tedious as to work, True
But when they seldom come they wishd for come, True
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents, True
So when this loose behavior I throw off, True
And pay the debt I never promised, True
By how much better than my word I am, True
By so much shall I falsify mens hopes, True
And like bright metal on a sullen ground, True
My reformation glittering oer my fault, True
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes, True
Than that which hath no foil to set it off, True
Ill so offend to make offence a skill, True
Redeeming time when men think least I will, True
SCENE III London The palace, True
Enter the KING NORTHUMBERLAND WORCESTER HOTSPUR SIR WALTER BLUNT with others, True
My blood hath been too cold and temperate, True
Unapt to stir at these indignities, True
And you have found me for accordingly, True
You tread upon my patience but be sure, True
I will from henceforth rather be myself, True
Mighty and to be feard than my condition, True
Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down, True
And therefore lost that title of respect, True
Which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud, True
Our house my sovereign liege little deserves, True
The scourge of greatness to be used on it, True
And that same greatness too which our own hands, True
Have holp to make so portly, True
Worcester get thee gone for I do see, True
Danger and disobedience in thine eye, True
O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory, True
And majesty might never yet endure, True
The moody frontier of a servant brow, True
You have good leave to leave us when we need, True
Your use and counsel we shall send for you, True
You were about to speak, True
Those prisoners in your highness name demanded, True
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took, True
Were as he says not with such strength denied, True
As is deliverd to your majesty, True
Either envy therefore or misprison, True
Is guilty of this fault and not my son, True
My liege I did deny no prisoners, True
But I remember when the fight was done, True
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, True
Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword, True
Came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressd, True
Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reapd, True
Showd like a stubbleland at harvesthome, True
He was perfumed like a milliner, True
And twixt his finger and his thumb he held, True
A pouncetbox which ever and anon, True
He gave his nose and tookt away again, True
Who therewith angry when it next came there, True
Took it in snuff and still he smiled and talkd, True
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, True
He calld them untaught knaves unmannerly, True
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse, True
Betwixt the wind and his nobility, True
With many holiday and lady terms, True
He questiond me amongst the rest demanded, True
My prisoners in your majestys behalf, True
I then all smarting with my wounds being cold, True
To be so pesterd with a popinjay, True
Out of my grief and my impatience, True
Answerd neglectingly I know not what, True
He should or he should not for he made me mad, True
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet, True
And talk so like a waitinggentlewoman, True
Of guns and drums and woundsGod save the mark, True
And telling me the sovereignst thing on earth, True
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise, True
And that it was great pity so it was, True
This villanous saltpetre should be diggd, True
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, True
Which many a good tall fellow had destroyd, True
So cowardly and but for these vile guns, True
He would himself have been a soldier, True
This bald unjointed chat of his my lord, True
I answerd indirectly as I said, True
And I beseech you let not his report, True
Come current for an accusation, True
Betwixt my love and your high majesty, True
The circumstance considerd good my lord, True
Whateer Lord Harry Percy then had said, True
To such a person and in such a place, True
At such a time with all the rest retold, True
May reasonably die and never rise, True
To do him wrong or any way impeach, True
What then he said so he unsay it now, True
Why yet he doth deny his prisoners, True
But with proviso and exception, True
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight, True
His brotherinlaw the foolish Mortimer, True
Who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd, True
The lives of those that he did lead to fight, True
Against that great magician damnd Glendower, True
Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March, True
Hath lately married Shall our coffers then, True
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home, True
Shall we but treason and indent with fears, True
When they have lost and forfeited themselves, True
No on the barren mountains let him starve, True
For I shall never hold that man my friend, True
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost, True
To ransom home revolted Mortimer, True
He never did fall off my sovereign liege, True
But by the chance of war to prove that true, True
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds, True
Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took, True
When on the gentle Severns sedgy bank, True
In single opposition hand to hand, True
He did confound the best part of an hour, True
In changing hardiment with great Glendower, True
Three times they breathed and three times did, True
Upon agreement of swift Severns flood, True
Who then affrighted with their bloody looks, True
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds, True
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, True
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants, True
Never did base and rotten policy, True
Colour her working with such deadly wounds, True
Nor could the noble Mortimer, True
Receive so many and all willingly, True
Then let not him be slanderd with revolt, True
Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him, True
He never did encounter with Glendower, True
He durst as well have met the devil alone, True
As Owen Glendower for an enemy, True
Art thou not ashamed But sirrah henceforth, True
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer, True
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means, True
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me, True
As will displease you My Lord Northumberland, True
We licence your departure with your son, True
Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it, True
Exeunt King Henry Blunt and train, True
An if the devil come and roar for them, True
I will not send them I will after straight, True
And tell him so for I will ease my heart, True
Albeit I make a hazard of my head, True
What drunk with choler stay and pause awhile, True
Here comes your uncle, True
Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul, True
Want mercy if I do not join with him, True
Yea on his part Ill empty all these veins, True
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust, True
But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer, True
As high in the air as this unthankful king, True
As this ingrate and cankerd Bolingbroke, True
Brother the king hath made your nephew mad, True
Who struck this heat up after I was gone, True
He will forsooth have all my prisoners, True
And when I urged the ransom once again, True
Of my wifes brother then his cheek lookd pale, True
And on my face he turnd an eye of death, True
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer, True
I cannot blame him was not he proclaimd, True
By Richard that dead is the next of blood, True
He was I heard the proclamation, True
And then it was when the unhappy king, True
Whose wrongs in us God pardondid set forth, True
Upon his Irish expedition, True
From whence he intercepted did return, True
To be deposed and shortly murdered, True
And for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth, True
Live scandalized and foully spoken of, True
But soft I pray you did King Richard then, True
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer, True
He did myself did hear it, True
Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king, True
That wished him on the barren mountains starve, True
But shall it be that you that set the crown, True
Upon the head of this forgetful man, True
And for his sake wear the detested blot, True
Of murderous subornation shall it be, True
That you a world of curses undergo, True
Being the agents or base second means, True
The cords the ladder or the hangman rather, True
O pardon me that I descend so low, True
To show the line and the predicament, True
Wherein you range under this subtle king, True
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days, True
Or fill up chronicles in time to come, True
That men of your nobility and power, True
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf, True
As both of youGod pardon ithave done, True
To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose, True
An plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke, True
And shall it in more shame be further spoken, True
That you are foold discarded and shook off, True
By him for whom these shames ye underwent, True
No yet time serves wherein you may redeem, True
Your banishd honours and restore yourselves, True
Into the good thoughts of the world again, True
Revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt, True
Of this proud king who studies day and night, True
To answer all the debt he owes to you, True
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths, True
Peace cousin say no more, True
And now I will unclasp a secret book, True
And to your quickconceiving discontents, True
Ill read you matter deep and dangerous, True
As full of peril and adventurous spirit, True
As to oerwalk a current roaring loud, True
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear, True
If he fall in good night or sink or swim, True
Send danger from the east unto the west, True
So honour cross it from the north to south, True
And let them grapple O the blood more stirs, True
To rouse a lion than to start a hare, True
Imagination of some great exploit, True
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience, True
By heaven methinks it were an easy leap, True
To pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon, True
Or dive into the bottom of the deep, True
Where fathomline could never touch the ground, True
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks, True
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear, True
Without corrival all her dignities, True
But out upon this halffaced fellowship, True
He apprehends a world of figures here, True
But not the form of what he should attend, True
Good cousin give me audience for a while, True
Those same noble Scots, True
That are your prisoners, True
By God he shall not have a Scot of them, True
No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not, True
Ill keep them by this hand, True
And lend no ear unto my purposes, True
Those prisoners you shall keep, True
Nay I will thats flat, True
He said he would not ransom Mortimer, True
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer, True
But I will find him when he lies asleep, True
And in his ear Ill holla Mortimer, True
Ill have a starling shall be taught to speak, True
Nothing but Mortimer and give it him, True
To keep his anger still in motion, True
Hear you cousin a word, True
All studies here I solemnly defy, True
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke, True
And that same swordandbuckler Prince of Wales, True
But that I think his father loves him not, True
And would be glad he met with some mischance, True
I would have him poisond with a pot of ale, True
Farewell kinsman Ill talk to you, True
When you are better temperd to attend, True
Why what a waspstung and impatient fool, True
Art thou to break into this womans mood, True
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own, True
Why look you I am whippd and scourged with rods, True
Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear, True
Of this vile politician Bolingbroke, True
In Richards timewhat do you call the place, True
A plague upon it it is in Gloucestershire, True
Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept, True
His uncle York where I first bowd my knee, True
Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke, True
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh, True
Why what a candy deal of courtesy, True
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me, True
Lookwhen his infant fortune came to age, True
And gentle Harry Percy and kind cousin, True
O the devil take such cozeners God forgive me, True
Good uncle tell your tale I have done, True
Nay if you have not to it again, True
We will stay your leisure, True
I have done i faith, True
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners, True
Deliver them up without their ransom straight, True
And make the Douglas son your only mean, True
For powers in Scotland which for divers reasons, True
Which I shall send you written be assured, True
Will easily be granted You my lord, True
Your son in Scotland being thus employd, True
Shall secretly into the bosom creep, True
Of that same noble prelate well beloved, True
His brothers death at Bristol the Lord Scroop, True
I speak not this in estimation, True
As what I think might be but what I know, True
Is ruminated plotted and set down, True
And only stays but to behold the face, True
Of that occasion that shall bring it on, True
I smell it upon my life it will do well, True
Before the game is afoot thou still letst slip, True
Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot, True
And then the power of Scotland and of York, True
To join with Mortimer ha, True
In faith it is exceedingly well aimd, True
And tis no little reason bids us speed, True
To save our heads by raising of a head, True
For bear ourselves as even as we can, True
The king will always think him in our debt, True
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied, True
Till he hath found a time to pay us home, True
And see already how he doth begin, True
To make us strangers to his looks of love, True
He does he does well be revenged on him, True
Cousin farewell no further go in this, True
Than I by letters shall direct your course, True
When time is ripe which will be suddenly, True
Ill steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer, True
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once, True
As I will fashion it shall happily meet, True
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms, True

And you in hell as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of, True
I cannot blame him at my nativity, True
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, True
Of burning cressets and at my birth, True
The frame and huge foundation of the earth, True
Shaked like a coward, True
Why so it would have done at the same season if, True
your mothers cat had but kittened though yourself, True
I say the earth did shake when I was born, True
And I say the earth was not of my mind, True
If you suppose as fearing you it shook, True
The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble, True
O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire, True
And not in fear of your nativity, True
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth, True
In strange eruptions oft the teeming earth, True
Is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd, True
By the imprisoning of unruly wind, True
Within her womb which for enlargement striving, True
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down, True
Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth, True
Our grandam earth having this distemperature, True
I do not bear these crossings Give me leave, True
To tell you once again that at my birth, True
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, True
The goats ran from the mountains and the herds, True
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields, True
These signs have markd me extraordinary, True
And all the courses of my life do show, True
I am not in the roll of common men, True
Where is he living clippd in with the sea, True
That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales, True
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me, True
And bring him out that is but womans son, True
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art, True
And hold me pace in deep experiments, True
I think theres no man speaks better Welsh, True
Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad, True
I can call spirits from the vasty deep, True
Why so can I or so can any man, True
But will they come when you do call for them, True
Why I can teach you cousin to command, True
And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil, True
By telling truth tell truth and shame the devil, True
If thou have power to raise him bring him hither, True
And Ill be sworn I have power to shame him hence, True
O while you live tell truth and shame the devil, True
Come come no more of this unprofitable chat, True
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head, True
Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye, True
And sandybottomd Severn have I sent him, True
Bootless home and weatherbeaten back, True
Home without boots and in foul weather too, True
How scapes he agues in the devils name, True
Come heres the map shall we divide our right, True
According to our threefold order taen, True
The archdeacon hath divided it, True
Into three limits very equally, True
England from Trent and Severn hitherto, True
By south and east is to my part assignd, True
All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore, True
And all the fertile land within that bound, True
To Owen Glendower and dear coz to you, True
The remnant northward lying off from Trent, True
And our indentures tripartite are drawn, True
Which being sealed interchangeably, True
A business that this night may execute, True
Tomorrow cousin Percy you and I, True
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth, True
To meet your father and the Scottish power, True
As is appointed us at Shrewsbury, True
My father Glendower is not ready yet, True
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days, True
Within that space you may have drawn together, True
Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen, True
A shorter time shall send me to you lords, True
And in my conduct shall your ladies come, True
From whom you now must steal and take no leave, True
For there will be a world of water shed, True
Upon the parting of your wives and you, True
Methinks my moiety north from Burton here, True
In quantity equals not one of yours, True
See how this river comes me cranking in, True
And cuts me from the best of all my land, True
A huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out, True
Ill have the current in this place dammd up, True
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run, True
In a new channel fair and evenly, True
It shall not wind with such a deep indent, True
To rob me of so rich a bottom here, True
Not wind it shall it must you see it doth, True
Mark how he bears his course and runs me up, True
With like advantage on the other side, True
Gelding the opposed continent as much, True
As on the other side it takes from you, True
Yea but a little charge will trench him here, True
And on this north side win this cape of land, True
And then he runs straight and even, True
Ill have it so a little charge will do it, True
Ill not have it alterd, True
No nor you shall not, True
Who shall say me nay, True
Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh, True
I can speak English lord as well as you, True
For I was traind up in the English court, True
Where being but young I framed to the harp, True
Many an English ditty lovely well, True
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament, True
A virtue that was never seen in you, True
And I am glad of it with all my heart, True
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew, True
Than one of these same metre balladmongers, True
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turnd, True
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree, True
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge, True
Nothing so much as mincing poetry, True
Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag, True
Come you shall have Trent turnd, True
I do not care Ill give thrice so much land, True
To any welldeserving friend, True
But in the way of bargain mark ye me, True
Ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair, True
Are the indentures drawn shall we be gone, True
The moon shines fair you may away by night, True
Ill haste the writer and withal, True
Break with your wives of your departure hence, True
I am afraid my daughter will run mad, True
So much she doteth on her Mortimer, True
Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father, True
I cannot choose sometime he angers me, True
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant, True
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, True
And of a dragon and a finless fish, True
A clipwingd griffin and a moulten raven, True
A couching lion and a ramping cat, True
And such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff, True
As puts me from my faith I tell you what, True
He held me last night at least nine hours, True
In reckoning up the several devils names, True
That were his lackeys I cried hum and well go to, True
But markd him not a word O he is as tedious, True
As a tired horse a railing wife, True
Worse than a smoky house I had rather live, True
With cheese and garlic in a windmill far, True
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me, True
In any summerhouse in Christendom, True
In faith he is a worthy gentleman, True
Exceedingly well read and profited, True
In strange concealments valiant as a lion, True
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful, True
As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin, True
He holds your temper in a high respect, True
And curbs himself even of his natural scope, True
When you come cross his humour faith he does, True
I warrant you that man is not alive, True
Might so have tempted him as you have done, True
Without the taste of danger and reproof, True
But do not use it oft let me entreat you, True
In faith my lord you are too wilfulblame, True
And since your coming hither have done enough, True
To put him quite beside his patience, True
You must needs learn lord to amend this fault, True
Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood, True
And thats the dearest grace it renders you, True
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage, True
Defect of manners want of government, True
Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain, True
The least of which haunting a nobleman, True
Loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain, True
Upon the beauty of all parts besides, True
Beguiling them of commendation, True
Well I am schoold good manners be your speed, True
Here come our wives and let us take our leave, True
Reenter GLENDOWER with the ladies, True
This is the deadly spite that angers me, True
My wife can speak no English I no Welsh, True
My daughter weeps she will not part with you, True
Shell be a soldier too shell to the wars, True
Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy, True
Shall follow in your conduct speedily, True
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh and she answers him in the same, True
She is desperate here a peevish selfwind harlotry, True
one that no persuasion can do good upon, True
The lady speaks in Welsh, True
I understand thy looks that pretty Welsh, True
Which thou pourst down from these swelling heavens, True
I am too perfect in and but for shame, True
In such a parley should I answer thee, True
The lady speaks again in Welsh, True
I understand thy kisses and thou mine, True
And thats a feeling disputation, True
But I will never be a truant love, True
Till I have learned thy language for thy tongue, True
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd, True
Sung by a fair queen in a summers bower, True
With ravishing division to her lute, True
Nay if you melt then will she run mad, True
The lady speaks again in Welsh, True
O I am ignorance itself in this, True
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down, True
And rest your gentle head upon her lap, True
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you, True
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep, True
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness, True
Making such difference twixt wake and sleep, True
As is the difference betwixt day and night, True
The hour before the heavenlyharnessd team, True
Begins his golden progress in the east, True
With all my heart Ill sit and hear her sing, True
By that time will our book I think be drawn, True
And those musicians that shall play to you, True
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence, True
And straight they shall be here sit and attend, True
Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down come, True
quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap, True
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh, True
And tis no marvel he is so humorous, True
Byr lady he is a good musician, True
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are, True
altogether governed by humours Lie still ye thief, True
and hear the lady sing in Welsh, True
I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish, True
Wouldst thou have thy head broken, True
Neithertis a womans fault, True
To the Welsh ladys bed, True
Here the lady sings a Welsh song, True
Come Kate Ill have your song too, True
Not mine in good sooth, True
Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a, True
comfitmakers wife Not you in good sooth and, True
as true as I live and as God shall mend me and, True
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths, True
As if thou never walkst further than Finsbury, True
Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art, True
A good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth, True
And such protest of peppergingerbread, True
To velvetguards and Sundaycitizens, True
Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast, True
teacher An the indentures be drawn Ill away, True
within these two hours and so come in when ye will, True
Come come Lord Mortimer you are as slow, True
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go, True
By this our book is drawn well but seal, True
And then to horse immediately, True
SCENE II London The palace, True
Enter KING HENRY IV PRINCE HENRY and others, True
Lords give us leave the Prince of Wales and I, True
Must have some private conference but be near at hand, True
For we shall presently have need of you, True
I know not whether God will have it so, True
For some displeasing service I have done, True
That in his secret doom out of my blood, True
Hell breed revengement and a scourge for me, True
But thou dost in thy passages of life, True
Make me believe that thou art only markd, True
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven, True
To punish my mistreadings Tell me else, True
Could such inordinate and low desires, True
Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts, True
Such barren pleasures rude society, True
As thou art matchd withal and grafted to, True
Accompany the greatness of thy blood, True
And hold their level with thy princely heart, True
So please your majesty I would I could, True
Quit all offences with as clear excuse, True
As well as I am doubtless I can purge, True
Myself of many I am charged withal, True
Yet such extenuation let me beg, True
As in reproof of many tales devised, True
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear, True
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers, True
I may for some things true wherein my youth, True
Hath faulty wanderd and irregular, True
Find pardon on my true submission, True
God pardon thee yet let me wonder Harry, True
At thy affections which do hold a wing, True
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors, True
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost, True
Which by thy younger brother is supplied, True
And art almost an alien to the hearts, True
Of all the court and princes of my blood, True
The hope and expectation of thy time, True
Is ruind and the soul of every man, True
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall, True
Had I so lavish of my presence been, True
So commonhackneyd in the eyes of men, True
So stale and cheap to vulgar company, True
Opinion that did help me to the crown, True
Had still kept loyal to possession, True
And left me in reputeless banishment, True
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood, True
By being seldom seen I could not stir, True
But like a comet I was wonderd at, True
That men would tell their children This is he, True
Others would say Where which is Bolingbroke, True
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven, True
And dressd myself in such humility, True
That I did pluck allegiance from mens hearts, True
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths, True
Even in the presence of the crowned king, True
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new, True
My presence like a robe pontifical, True
Neer seen but wonderd at and so my state, True
Seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast, True
And won by rareness such solemnity, True
The skipping king he ambled up and down, True
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits, True
Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state, True
Mingled his royalty with capering fools, True
Had his great name profaned with their scorns, True
And gave his countenance against his name, True
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push, True
Of every beardless vain comparative, True
Grew a companion to the common streets, True
Enfeoffd himself to popularity, True
That being daily swallowd by mens eyes, True
They surfeited with honey and began, True
To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little, True
More than a little is by much too much, True
So when he had occasion to be seen, True
He was but as the cuckoo is in June, True
Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes, True
As sick and blunted with community, True
Afford no extraordinary gaze, True
Such as is bent on sunlike majesty, True
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes, True
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down, True
Slept in his face and renderd such aspect, True
As cloudy men use to their adversaries, True
Being with his presence glutted gorged and full, True
And in that very line Harry standest thou, True
For thou has lost thy princely privilege, True
With vile participation not an eye, True
But is aweary of thy common sight, True
Save mine which hath desired to see thee more, True
Which now doth that I would not have it do, True
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness, True
I shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord, True
As thou art to this hour was Richard then, True
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh, True
And even as I was then is Percy now, True
Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot, True
He hath more worthy interest to the state, True
Than thou the shadow of succession, True
For of no right nor colour like to right, True
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm, True
Turns head against the lions armed jaws, True
And being no more in debt to years than thou, True
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on, True
To bloody battles and to bruising arms, True
What neverdying honour hath he got, True
Against renowned Douglas whose high deeds, True
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms, True
Holds from all soldiers chief majority, True
And military title capital, True
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ, True
Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes, True
This infant warrior in his enterprises, True
Discomfited great Douglas taen him once, True
Enlarged him and made a friend of him, True
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up, True
And shake the peace and safety of our throne, True
And what say you to this Percy Northumberland, True
The Archbishops grace of York Douglas Mortimer, True
Capitulate against us and are up, True
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee, True
Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes, True
Which art my nearst and dearest enemy, True
Thou that art like enough through vassal fear, True
Base inclination and the start of spleen, True
To fight against me under Percys pay, True
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns, True
To show how much thou art degenerate, True
Do not think so you shall not find it so, True
And God forgive them that so much have swayd, True
Your majestys good thoughts away from me, True
I will redeem all this on Percys head, True
And in the closing of some glorious day, True
Be bold to tell you that I am your son, True
When I will wear a garment all of blood, True
And stain my favours in a bloody mask, True
Which washd away shall scour my shame with it, True
And that shall be the day wheneer it lights, True
That this same child of honour and renown, True
This gallant Hotspur this allpraised knight, True
And your unthoughtof Harry chance to meet, True
For every honour sitting on his helm, True
Would they were multitudes and on my head, True
My shames redoubled for the time will come, True
That I shall make this northern youth exchange, True
His glorious deeds for my indignities, True
Percy is but my factor good my lord, True
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf, True
And I will call him to so strict account, True
That he shall render every glory up, True
Yea even the slightest worship of his time, True
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart, True
This in the name of God I promise here, True
The which if He be pleased I shall perform, True
I do beseech your majesty may salve, True
The longgrown wounds of my intemperance, True
If not the end of life cancels all bands, True
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths, True
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow, True
A hundred thousand rebels die in this, True
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein, True
How now good Blunt thy looks are full of speed, True
So hath the business that I come to speak of, True
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word, True
That Douglas and the English rebels met, True
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury, True
A mighty and a fearful head they are, True
If promises be kept on every hand, True
As ever offerd foul play in the state, True

Enter HOTSPUR WORCESTER and DOUGLAS, True
Well said my noble Scot if speaking truth, True
In this fine age were not thought flattery, True
Such attribution should the Douglas have, True
As not a soldier of this seasons stamp, True
Should go so general current through the world, True
By God I cannot flatter I do defy, True
The tongues of soothers but a braver place, True
In my hearts love hath no man than yourself, True
Nay task me to my word approve me lord, True
Thou art the king of honour, True
No man so potent breathes upon the ground, True
But I will beard him, True
Do so and tis well, True
Enter a Messenger with letters, True
What letters hast thou thereI can but thank you, True
These letters come from your father, True
Letters from him why comes he not himself, True
He cannot come my lord he is grievous sick, True
Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick, True
In such a rustling time Who leads his power, True
Under whose government come they along, True
His letters bear his mind not I my lord, True
I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed, True
He did my lord four days ere I set forth, True
And at the time of my departure thence, True
He was much feard by his physicians, True
I would the state of time had first been whole, True
Ere he by sickness had been visited, True
His health was never better worth than now, True
Sick now droop now this sickness doth infect, True
The very lifeblood of our enterprise, True
Tis catching hither even to our camp, True
He writes me here that inward sickness, True
And that his friends by deputation could not, True
So soon be drawn nor did he think it meet, True
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust, True
On any soul removed but on his own, True
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement, True
That with our small conjunction we should on, True
To see how fortune is disposed to us, True
For as he writes there is no quailing now, True
Because the king is certainly possessd, True
Of all our purposes What say you to it, True
Your fathers sickness is a maim to us, True
A perilous gash a very limb loppd off, True
And yet in faith it is not his present want, True
Seems more than we shall find it were it good, True
To set the exact wealth of all our states, True
All at one cast to set so rich a main, True
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour, True
It were not good for therein should we read, True
The very bottom and the soul of hope, True
The very list the very utmost bound, True
Faith and so we should, True
Where now remains a sweet reversion, True
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what, True
A comfort of retirement lives in this, True
A rendezvous a home to fly unto, True
If that the devil and mischance look big, True
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs, True
But yet I would your father had been here, True
The quality and hair of our attempt, True
Brooks no division it will be thought, True
By some that know not why he is away, True
That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike, True
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence, True
And think how such an apprehension, True
May turn the tide of fearful faction, True
And breed a kind of question in our cause, True
For well you know we of the offering side, True
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement, True
And stop all sightholes every loop from whence, True
The eye of reason may pry in upon us, True
This absence of your fathers draws a curtain, True
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear, True
Before not dreamt of, True
I rather of his absence make this use, True
It lends a lustre and more great opinion, True
A larger dare to our great enterprise, True
Than if the earl were here for men must think, True
If we without his help can make a head, True
To push against a kingdom with his help, True
We shall oerturn it topsyturvy down, True
Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole, True

Envy your great deservings and good name, True
Because you are not of our quality, True
But stand against us like an enemy, True
And God defend but still I should stand so, True
So long as out of limit and true rule, True
You stand against anointed majesty, True
But to my charge The king hath sent to know, True
The nature of your griefs and whereupon, True
You conjure from the breast of civil peace, True
Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land, True
Audacious cruelty If that the king, True
Have any way your good deserts forgot, True
Which he confesseth to be manifold, True
He bids you name your griefs and with all speed, True
You shall have your desires with interest, True
And pardon absolute for yourself and these, True
Herein misled by your suggestion, True
The king is kind and well we know the king, True
Knows at what time to promise when to pay, True
My father and my uncle and myself, True
Did give him that same royalty he wears, True
And when he was not six and twenty strong, True
Sick in the worlds regard wretched and low, True
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home, True
My father gave him welcome to the shore, True
And when he heard him swear and vow to God, True
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster, True
To sue his livery and beg his peace, True
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal, True
My father in kind heart and pity moved, True
Swore him assistance and performd it too, True
Now when the lords and barons of the realm, True
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him, True
The more and less came in with cap and knee, True
Met him in boroughs cities villages, True
Attended him on bridges stood in lanes, True
Laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths, True
Gave him their heirs as pages followd him, True
Even at the heels in golden multitudes, True
He presently as greatness knows itself, True
Steps me a little higher than his vow, True
Made to my father while his blood was poor, True
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh, True
And now forsooth takes on him to reform, True
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees, True
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth, True
Cries out upon abuses seems to weep, True
Over his countrys wrongs and by this face, True
This seeming brow of justice did he win, True
The hearts of all that he did angle for, True
Proceeded further cut me off the heads, True
Of all the favourites that the absent king, True
In deputation left behind him here, True
When he was personal in the Irish war, True
Tut I came not to hear this, True
In short time after he deposed the king, True
Soon after that deprived him of his life, True
And in the neck of that taskd the whole state, True
To make that worse sufferd his kinsman March, True
Who is if every owner were well placed, True
Indeed his king to be engaged in Wales, True
There without ransom to lie forfeited, True
Disgraced me in my happy victories, True
Sought to entrap me by intelligence, True
Rated mine uncle from the councilboard, True
In rage dismissd my father from the court, True
Broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong, True
And in conclusion drove us to seek out, True
This head of safety and withal to pry, True
Into his title the which we find, True
Too indirect for long continuance, True
Shall I return this answer to the king, True
Not so Sir Walter well withdraw awhile, True
Go to the king and let there be impawnd, True
Some surety for a safe return again, True
And in the morning early shall my uncle, True

To whom they are directed If you knew, True
How much they do to import you would make haste, True
Tomorrow good Sir Michael is a day, True
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men, True
Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury, True
As I am truly given to understand, True
The king with mighty and quickraised power, True
Meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael, True
What with the sickness of Northumberland, True
Whose power was in the first proportion, True
And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence, True
Who with them was a rated sinew too, True
And comes not in oerruled by prophecies, True
I fear the power of Percy is too weak, True
To wage an instant trial with the king, True
Why my good lord you need not fear, True
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer, True
No Mortimer is not there, True
But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy, True
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head, True
Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen, True
And so there is but yet the king hath drawn, True
The special head of all the land together, True
The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster, True
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt, True
And moe corrivals and dear men, True
Of estimation and command in arms, True
Doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed, True
I hope no less yet needful tis to fear, True
And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed, True
For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the king, True
Dismiss his power he means to visit us, True
For he hath heard of our confederacy, True
And tis but wisdom to make strong against him, True
Therefore make haste I must go write again, True

SCENE I KING HENRY IVs camp near Shrewsbury, True
Enter KING HENRY PRINCE HENRY Lord John of LANCASTER EARL OF WESTMORELAND SIR WALTER BLUNT and FALSTAFF, True
How bloodily the sun begins to peer, True
Above yon busky hill the day looks pale, True
At his distemperature, True
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes, True
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves, True
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day, True
Then with the losers let it sympathize, True
For nothing can seem foul to those that win, True
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON, True
How now my Lord of Worcester tis not well, True
That you and I should meet upon such terms, True
As now we meet You have deceived our trust, True
And made us doff our easy robes of peace, True
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel, True
This is not well my lord this is not well, True
What say you to it will you again unknit, True
This curlish knot of allabhorred war, True
And move in that obedient orb again, True
Where you did give a fair and natural light, True
And be no more an exhaled meteor, True
A prodigy of fear and a portent, True
Of broached mischief to the unborn times, True
For mine own part I could be well content, True
To entertain the lagend of my life, True
With quiet hours for I do protest, True
I have not sought the day of this dislike, True
You have not sought it how comes it then, True
Rebellion lay in his way and he found it, True
Peace chewet peace, True
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks, True
Of favour from myself and all our house, True
And yet I must remember you my lord, True
We were the first and dearest of your friends, True
For you my staff of office did I break, True
In Richards time and posted day and night, True
to meet you on the way and kiss your hand, True
When yet you were in place and in account, True
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I, True
It was myself my brother and his son, True
That brought you home and boldly did outdare, True
The dangers of the time You swore to us, True
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster, True
That you did nothing purpose gainst the state, True
Nor claim no further than your newfalln right, True
The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster, True
To this we swore our aid But in short space, True
It raind down fortune showering on your head, True
And such a flood of greatness fell on you, True
What with our help what with the absent king, True
What with the injuries of a wanton time, True
The seeming sufferances that you had borne, True
And the contrarious winds that held the king, True
So long in his unlucky Irish wars, True
That all in England did repute him dead, True
And from this swarm of fair advantages, True
You took occasion to be quickly wood, True
To gripe the general sway into your hand, True
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster, True
And being fed by us you used us so, True
As that ungentle hull the cuckoos bird, True
Useth the sparrow did oppress our nest, True
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk, True
That even our love durst not come near your sight, True
For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing, True
We were enforced for safety sake to fly, True
Out of sight and raise this present head, True
Whereby we stand opposed by such means, True
As you yourself have forged against yourself, True
By unkind usage dangerous countenance, True
And violation of all faith and troth, True
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise, True
These things indeed you have articulate, True
Proclaimd at marketcrosses read in churches, True
To face the garment of rebellion, True
With some fine colour that may please the eye, True
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents, True
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news, True
Of hurlyburly innovation, True
And never yet did insurrection want, True
Such watercolours to impaint his cause, True
Nor moody beggars starving for a time, True
Of pellmell havoc and confusion, True
In both your armies there is many a soul, True
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter, True
If once they join in trial Tell your nephew, True
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world, True
In praise of Henry Percy by my hopes, True
This present enterprise set off his head, True
I do not think a braver gentleman, True
More activevaliant or more valiantyoung, True
More daring or more bold is now alive, True
To grace this latter age with noble deeds, True
For my part I may speak it to my shame, True
I have a truant been to chivalry, True
And so I hear he doth account me too, True
Yet this before my fathers majesty, True
I am content that he shall take the odds, True
Of his great name and estimation, True
And will to save the blood on either side, True
Try fortune with him in a single fight, True
And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee, True
Albeit considerations infinite, True
Do make against it No good Worcester no, True
We love our people well even those we love, True
That are misled upon your cousins part, True
And will they take the offer of our grace, True
Both he and they and you every man, True
Shall be my friend again and Ill be his, True
So tell your cousin and bring me word, True
What he will do but if he will not yield, True
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us, True
And they shall do their office So be gone, True
We will not now be troubled with reply, True
We offer fair take it advisedly, True
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, True
It will not be accepted on my life, True
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together, True
Are confident against the world in arms, True
Hence therefore every leader to his charge, True
For on their answer will we set on them, True
And God befriend us as our cause is just, True
Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF, True
Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride, True

SCENE II The rebel camp, True
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON, True
O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard, True
The liberal and kind offer of the king, True
Then are we all undone, True
It is not possible it cannot be, True
The king should keep his word in loving us, True
He will suspect us still and find a time, True
To punish this offence in other faults, True
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes, True
For treason is but trusted like the fox, True
Who neer so tame so cherishd and lockd up, True
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors, True
Look how we can or sad or merrily, True
Interpretation will misquote our looks, True
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall, True
The better cherishd still the nearer death, True
My nephews trespass may be well forgot, True
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood, True
And an adopted name of privilege, True
A hairbraind Hotspur governd by a spleen, True
All his offences live upon my head, True
And on his fathers we did train him on, True
And his corruption being taen from us, True
We as the spring of all shall pay for all, True
Therefore good cousin let not Harry know, True
In any case the offer of the king, True
Deliver what you will Ill say tis so, True
Here comes your cousin, True

The king will bid you battle presently, True
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland, True
Lord Douglas go you and tell him so, True
Marry and shall and very willingly, True
There is no seeming mercy in the king, True
Did you beg any God forbid, True
I told him gently of our grievances, True
Of his oathbreaking which he mended thus, True
By now forswearing that he is forsworn, True
He calls us rebels traitors and will scourge, True
With haughty arms this hateful name in us, True
Reenter the EARL OF DOUGLAS, True
Arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown, True
A brave defiance in King Henrys teeth, True
And Westmoreland that was engaged did bear it, True
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on, True
The Prince of Wales steppd forth before the king, True
And nephew challenged you to single fight, True
O would the quarrel lay upon our heads, True
And that no man might draw short breath today, True
But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me, True
How showd his tasking seemd it in contempt, True
No by my soul I never in my life, True
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly, True
Unless a brother should a brother dare, True
To gentle exercise and proof of arms, True
He gave you all the duties of a man, True
Trimmd up your praises with a princely tongue, True
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle, True
Making you ever better than his praise, True
By still dispraising praise valued in you, True
And which became him like a prince indeed, True
He made a blushing cital of himself, True
And chid his truant youth with such a grace, True
As if he masterd there a double spirit, True
Of teaching and of learning instantly, True
There did he pause but let me tell the world, True
If he outlive the envy of this day, True
England did never owe so sweet a hope, True
So much misconstrued in his wantonness, True
Cousin I think thou art enamoured, True
On his follies never did I hear, True

Tis France for England, True
You men of Angiers and my loving subjects, True
You loving men of Angiers Arthurs subjects, True
Our trumpet calld you to this gentle parle, True
For our advantage therefore hear us first, True
These flags of France that are advanced here, True
Before the eye and prospect of your town, True
Have hither marchd to your endamagement, True
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath, True
And ready mounted are they to spit forth, True
Their iron indignation gainst your walls, True
All preparation for a bloody siege, True
All merciless proceeding by these French, True
Confronts your citys eyes your winking gates, True
And but for our approach those sleeping stones, True
That as a waist doth girdle you about, True
By the compulsion of their ordinance, True
By this time from their fixed beds of lime, True
Had been dishabited and wide havoc made, True
For bloody power to rush upon your peace, True
But on the sight of us your lawful king, True
Who painfully with much expedient march, True
Have brought a countercheque before your gates, True
To save unscratchd your citys threatened cheeks, True
Behold the French amazed vouchsafe a parle, True
And now instead of bullets wrappd in fire, True
To make a shaking fever in your walls, True
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke, True
To make a faithless error in your ears, True
Which trust accordingly kind citizens, True
And let us in your king whose labourd spirits, True
Forwearied in this action of swift speed, True
Crave harbourage within your city walls, True
When I have said make answer to us both, True
Lo in this right hand whose protection, True
Is most divinely vowd upon the right, True
Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet, True

And king oer him and all that he enjoys, True
For this downtrodden equity we tread, True

In the relief of this oppressed child, True
Religiously provokes Be pleased then, True
To pay that duty which you truly owe, True

With unhackd swords and helmets all unbruised, True
We will bear home that lusty blood again, True
Which here we came to spout against your town, True
And leave your children wives and you in peace, True
But if you fondly pass our profferd offer, True
Tis not the roundure of your oldfaced walls, True
Can hide you from our messengers of war, True
Though all these English and their discipline, True
Were harbourd in their rude circumference, True
Then tell us shall your city call us lord, True
In that behalf which we have challenged it, True
Or shall we give the signal to our rage, True
And stalk in blood to our possession, True
In brief we are the king of Englands subjects, True
For him and in his right we hold this town, True
Acknowledge then the king and let me in, True
That can we not but he that proves the king, True
To him will we prove loyal till that time, True
Have we rammd up our gates against the world, True
Doth not the crown of England prove the king, True
And if not that I bring you witnesses, True
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of Englands breed, True
To verify our title with their lives, True
As many and as wellborn bloods as those, True
Stand in his face to contradict his claim, True
Till you compound whose right is worthiest, True
We for the worthiest hold the right from both, True
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls, True
That to their everlasting residence, True
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet, True
In dreadful trial of our kingdoms king, True
Amen amen Mount chevaliers to arms, True
Saint George that swinged the dragon and eer since, True
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess door, True

Here after excursions enter the Herald of France with trumpets to the gates, True
You men of Angiers open wide your gates, True
And let young Arthur Duke of Bretagne in, True
Who by the hand of France this day hath made, True
Much work for tears in many an English mother, True
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground, True
Many a widows husband grovelling lies, True
Coldly embracing the discolourd earth, True
And victory with little loss doth play, True
Upon the dancing banners of the French, True
Who are at hand triumphantly displayd, True
To enter conquerors and to proclaim, True
Arthur of Bretagne Englands king and yours, True
Enter English Herald with trumpet, True
Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells, True
King John your king and Englands doth approach, True
Commander of this hot malicious day, True
Their armours that marchd hence so silverbright, True
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmens blood, True
There stuck no plume in any English crest, True
That is removed by a staff of France, True
Our colours do return in those same hands, True
That did display them when we first marchd forth, True
And like a troop of jolly huntsmen come, True
Our lusty English all with purpled hands, True
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes, True
Open your gates and gives the victors way, True
Heralds from off our towers we might behold, True
From first to last the onset and retire, True
Of both your armies whose equality, True
By our best eyes cannot be censured, True
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows, True
Strength matchd with strength and power confronted power, True
Both are alike and both alike we like, True
One must prove greatest while they weigh so even, True
We hold our town for neither yet for both, True
Reenter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP with their powers severally, True
France hast thou yet more blood to cast away, True
Say shall the current of our right run on, True
Whose passage vexd with thy impediment, True
Shall leave his native channel and oerswell, True
With course disturbd even thy confining shores, True
Unless thou let his silver water keep, True
A peaceful progress to the ocean, True
England thou hast not saved one drop of blood, True
In this hot trial more than we of France, True
Rather lost more And by this hand I swear, True
That sways the earth this climate overlooks, True
Before we will lay down our justborne arms, True
Well put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear, True
Or add a royal number to the dead, True
Gracing the scroll that tells of this wars loss, True
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings, True
Ha majesty how high thy glory towers, True
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire, True
O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel, True
The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs, True
And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men, True
In undetermined differences of kings, True
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus, True
Cry havoc kings back to the stained field, True
You equal potents fiery kindled spirits, True
Then let confusion of one part confirm, True
The others peace till then blows blood and death, True
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit, True
Speak citizens for England whos your king, True
The king of England when we know the king, True
Know him in us that here hold up his right, True
In us that are our own great deputy, True
And bear possession of our person here, True
Lord of our presence Angiers and of you, True
A greater power then we denies all this, True
And till it be undoubted we do lock, True
Our former scruple in our strongbarrd gates, True
Kingd of our fears until our fears resolved, True
Be by some certain king purged and deposed, True
By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings, True
And stand securely on their battlements, True
As in a theatre whence they gape and point, True
At your industrious scenes and acts of death, True
Your royal presences be ruled by me, True
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem, True
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend, True
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town, True
By east and west let France and England mount, True
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths, True
Till their soulfearing clamours have brawld down, True
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city, True
Ild play incessantly upon these jades, True
Even till unfenced desolation, True
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air, True
That done dissever your united strengths, True
And part your mingled colours once again, True
Turn face to face and bloody point to point, True
Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth, True
Out of one side her happy minion, True
To whom in favour she shall give the day, True
And kiss him with a glorious victory, True
How like you this wild counsel mighty states, True
Smacks it not something of the policy, True
Now by the sky that hangs above our heads, True
I like it well France shall we knit our powers, True
And lay this Angiers even to the ground, True
Then after fight who shall be king of it, True
An if thou hast the mettle of a king, True
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town, True
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery, True
As we will ours against these saucy walls, True
And when that we have dashd them to the ground, True
Why then defy each other and pellmell, True
Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell, True
Let it be so Say where will you assault, True
We from the west will send destruction, True
Into this citys bosom, True
Our thunder from the south, True
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town, True
O prudent discipline From north to south, True
Austria and France shoot in each others mouth, True
Ill stir them to it Come away away, True
Hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay, True
And I shall show you peace and fairfaced league, True
Win you this city without stroke or wound, True
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds, True
That here come sacrifices for the field, True
Persever not but hear me mighty kings, True
Speak on with favour we are bent to hear, True
That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch, True
Is niece to England look upon the years, True
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid, True
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty, True
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch, True
If zealous love should go in search of virtue, True
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch, True
If love ambitious sought a match of birth, True
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch, True
Such as she is in beauty virtue birth, True
Is the young Dauphin every way complete, True
If not complete of say he is not she, True
And she again wants nothing to name want, True
If want it be not that she is not he, True
He is the half part of a blessed man, True
Left to be finished by such as she, True
And she a fair divided excellence, True
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him, True
O two such silver currents when they join, True
Do glorify the banks that bound them in, True
And two such shores to two such streams made one, True
Two such controlling bounds shall you be kings, True
To these two princes if you marry them, True
This union shall do more than battery can, True
To our fastclosed gates for at this match, True
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce, True
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope, True
And give you entrance but without this match, True
The sea enraged is not half so deaf, True
Lions more confident mountains and rocks, True
More free from motion no not Death himself, True
In moral fury half so peremptory, True
As we to keep this city, True
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death, True
Out of his rags Heres a large mouth indeed, True
That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas, True
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions, True
As maids of thirteen do of puppydogs, True
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood, True
He speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce, True
He gives the bastinado with his tongue, True
Our ears are cudgelld not a word of his, True
But buffets better than a fist of France, True
Zounds I was never so bethumpd with words, True
Since I first calld my brothers father dad, True
Son list to this conjunction make this match, True
Give with our niece a dowry large enough, True
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie, True
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown, True
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe, True
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit, True
I see a yielding in the looks of France, True
Mark how they whisper urge them while their souls, True
Are capable of this ambition, True
Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath, True
Of soft petitions pity and remorse, True
Cool and congeal again to what it was, True
Why answer not the double majesties, True
This friendly treaty of our threatend town, True
Speak England first that hath been forward first, True
To speak unto this city what say you, True
If that the Dauphin there thy princely son, True
Can in this book of beauty read I love, True
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen, True
For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers, True
And all that we upon this side the sea, True
Except this city now by us besieged, True
Find liable to our crown and dignity, True
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich, True
In titles honours and promotions, True
As she in beauty education blood, True
Holds hand with any princess of the world, True
What sayst thou boy look in the ladys face, True
I do my lord and in her eye I find, True
A wonder or a wondrous miracle, True
The shadow of myself formd in her eye, True
Which being but the shadow of your son, True
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow, True
I do protest I never loved myself, True
Till now infixed I beheld myself, True
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye, True
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye, True
Hangd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow, True
And quarterd in her heart he doth espy, True
Himself loves traitor this is pity now, True
That hangd and drawn and quartered there should be, True
In such a love so vile a lout as he, True
My uncles will in this respect is mine, True
If he see aught in you that makes him like, True
That any thing he sees which moves his liking, True
I can with ease translate it to my will, True
Or if you will to speak more properly, True
I will enforce it easily to my love, True
Further I will not flatter you my lord, True
That all I see in you is worthy love, True
Than this that nothing do I see in you, True
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge, True
That I can find should merit any hate, True
What say these young ones What say you my niece, True
That she is bound in honour still to do, True
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say, True
Speak then prince Dauphin can you love this lady, True
Nay ask me if I can refrain from love, True
For I do love her most unfeignedly, True
Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine, True
Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces, True
With her to thee and this addition more, True
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin, True
Philip of France if thou be pleased withal, True
Command thy son and daughter to join hands, True
It likes us well young princes close your hands, True
And your lips too for I am well assured, True
That I did so when I was first assured, True
Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates, True
Let in that amity which you have made, True
For at Saint Marys chapel presently, True
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized, True
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop, True
I know she is not for this match made up, True
Her presence would have interrupted much, True
Where is she and her son tell me who knows, True
She is sad and passionate at your highness tent, True
And by my faith this league that we have made, True
Will give her sadness very little cure, True
Brother of England how may we content, True
This widow lady In her right we came, True
Which we God knows have turnd another way, True
For well create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne, True
And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town, True
We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance, True
Some speedy messenger bid her repair, True
To our solemnity I trust we shall, True
If not fill up the measure of her will, True
Yet in some measure satisfy her so, True
That we shall stop her exclamation, True
Go we as well as haste will suffer us, True
To this unlookd for unprepared pomp, True
Exeunt all but the BASTARD, True
Mad world mad kings mad composition, True
John to stop Arthurs title in the whole, True
Hath willingly departed with a part, True
And France whose armour conscience buckled on, True
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field, True
As Gods own soldier rounded in the ear, True
With that same purposechanger that sly devil, True
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith, True
That daily breakvow he that wins of all, True
Of kings of beggars old men young men maids, True
Who having no external thing to lose, True
But the word maid cheats the poor maid of that, True
That smoothfaced gentleman tickling Commodity, True
Commodity the bias of the world, True
The world who of itself is peised well, True
Made to run even upon even ground, True
Till this advantage this viledrawing bias, True
This sway of motion this Commodity, True
Makes it take head from all indifferency, True
From all direction purpose course intent, True
And this same bias this Commodity, True
This bawd this broker this allchanging word, True
Clappd on the outward eye of fickle France, True
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid, True
From a resolved and honourable war, True
To a most base and vileconcluded peace, True
And why rail I on this Commodity, True
But for because he hath not wood me yet, True
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand, True
When his fair angels would salute my palm, True
But for my hand as unattempted yet, True
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich, True
Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail, True
And say there is no sin but to be rich, True
And being rich my virtue then shall be, True
To say there is no vice but beggary, True
Since kings break faith upon commodity, True
Gain be my lord for I will worship thee, True

Why thou against the church our holy mother, True
So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce, True

Of Canterbury from that holy see, True
This in our foresaid holy fathers name, True
Pope Innocent I do demand of thee, True
What earthy name to interrogatories, True
Can task the free breath of a sacred king, True
Thou canst not cardinal devise a name, True
So slight unworthy and ridiculous, True
To charge me to an answer as the pope, True
Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England, True
Add thus much more that no Italian priest, True
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions, True
But as we under heaven are supreme head, True
So under Him that great supremacy, True
Where we do reign we will alone uphold, True
Without the assistance of a mortal hand, True
So tell the pope all reverence set apart, True
To him and his usurpd authority, True
Brother of England you blaspheme in this, True
Though you and all the kings of Christendom, True
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest, True
Dreading the curse that money may buy out, True
And by the merit of vile gold dross dust, True
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man, True
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself, True
Though you and all the rest so grossly led, True
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish, True
Yet I alone alone do me oppose, True
Against the pope and count his friends my foes, True
Then by the lawful power that I have, True
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate, True
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt, True
From his allegiance to an heretic, True
And meritorious shall that hand be calld, True
Canonized and worshipped as a saint, True
That takes away by any secret course, True
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile, True
Good father cardinal cry thou amen, True
To my keen curses for without my wrong, True
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right, True
Theres law and warrant lady for my curse, True
And for mine too when law can do no right, True
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong, True
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here, True
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law, True
Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong, True
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse, True
Philip of France on peril of a curse, True
Let go the hand of that archheretic, True
And raise the power of France upon his head, True
Unless he do submit himself to Rome, True
Lookst thou pale France do not let go thy hand, True
Look to that devil lest that France repent, True
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul, True
King Philip listen to the cardinal, True
And hang a calfsskin on his recreant limbs, True
Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs Because, True
Your breeches best may carry them, True
Philip what sayst thou to the cardinal, True
What should he say but as the cardinal, True
Bethink you father for the difference, True

Or the light loss of England for a friend, True
Thats the curse of Rome, True
O Lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here, True
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride, True
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith, True
O if thou grant my need, True
Which only lives but by the death of faith, True
That need must needs infer this principle, True
That faith would live again by death of need, True
O then tread down my need and faith mounts up, True
Keep my need up and faith is trodden down, True
The king is moved and answers not to this, True
O be removed from him and answer well, True
Do so King Philip hang no more in doubt, True
Hang nothing but a calfsskin most sweet lout, True
I am perplexd and know not what to say, True
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more, True
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed, True
Good reverend father make my person yours, True
And tell me how you would bestow yourself, True
This royal hand and mine are newly knit, True
And the conjunction of our inward souls, True
Married in league coupled and linked together, True
With all religious strength of sacred vows, True
The latest breath that gave the sound of words, True
Was deepsworn faith peace amity true love, True
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves, True
And even before this truce but new before, True
No longer than we well could wash our hands, True
To clap this royal bargain up of peace, True
Heaven knows they were besmeard and overstaind, True
With slaughters pencil where revenge did paint, True
The fearful difference of incensed kings, True
And shall these hands so lately purged of blood, True
So newly joind in love so strong in both, True
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet, True
Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven, True
Make such unconstant children of ourselves, True
As now again to snatch our palm from palm, True
Unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed, True
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host, True
And make a riot on the gentle brow, True
Of true sincerity O holy sir, True
My reverend father let it not be so, True
Out of your grace devise ordain impose, True
Some gentle order and then we shall be blest, True
To do your pleasure and continue friends, True
All form is formless order orderless, True
Save what is opposite to Englands love, True
Therefore to arms be champion of our church, True
Or let the church our mother breathe her curse, True
A mothers curse on her revolting son, True
France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue, True
A chafed lion by the mortal paw, True
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth, True
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold, True
I may disjoin my hand but not my faith, True
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith, True
And like a civil war setst oath to oath, True
Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow, True
First made to heaven first be to heaven performd, True
That is to be the champion of our church, True
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself, True
And may not be performed by thyself, True
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss, True
Is not amiss when it is truly done, True
And being not done where doing tends to ill, True
The truth is then most done not doing it, True
The better act of purposes mistook, True
Is to mistake again though indirect, True
Yet indirection thereby grows direct, True
And falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire, True
Within the scorched veins of one newburnd, True
It is religion that doth make vows kept, True
But thou hast sworn against religion, True
By what thou swearst against the thing thou swearst, True
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth, True
Against an oath the truth thou art unsure, True
To swear swears only not to be forsworn, True
Else what a mockery should it be to swear, True
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn, True
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear, True
Therefore thy later vows against thy first, True
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself, True
And better conquest never canst thou make, True
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts, True
Against these giddy loose suggestions, True
Upon which better part our prayers come in, True
If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know, True
The peril of our curses light on thee, True
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off, True
But in despair die under their black weight, True
Rebellion flat rebellion, True
Will not a calfsskin stop that mouth of thine, True
Upon thy weddingday, True
Against the blood that thou hast married, True
What shall our feast be kept with slaughterd men, True
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums, True
Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp, True
O husband hear me ay alack how new, True
Is husband in my mouth even for that name, True
Which till this time my tongue did neer pronounce, True
Upon my knee I beg go not to arms, True
Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee, True
Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom, True
Forethought by heaven, True
Now shall I see thy love what motive may, True
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife, True
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds, True
His honour O thine honour Lewis thine honour, True
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold, True
When such profound respects do pull you on, True
I will denounce a curse upon his head, True

O foul revolt of French inconstancy, True
France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour, True
Old Time the clocksetter that bald sexton Time, True

Which is the side that I must go withal, True
I am with both each army hath a hand, True
And in their rage I having hold of both, True
They swirl asunder and dismember me, True
Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win, True
Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose, True
Father I may not wish the fortune thine, True
Grandam I will not wish thy fortunes thrive, True
Whoever wins on that side shall I lose, True
Assured loss before the match be playd, True
Lady with me with me thy fortune lies, True
There where my fortune lives there my life dies, True
Cousin go draw our puissance together, True

A rage whose heat hath this condition, True

If this same were a churchyard where we stand, True
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs, True

Lady you utter madness and not sorrow, True
Thou art not holy to belie me so, True
I am not mad this hair I tear is mine, True
My name is Constance I was Geffreys wife, True
Young Arthur is my son and he is lost, True
I am not mad I would to heaven I were, True
For then tis like I should forget myself, True
O if I could what grief should I forget, True
Preach some philosophy to make me mad, True
And thou shalt be canonized cardinal, True
For being not mad but sensible of grief, True
My reasonable part produces reason, True
How I may be deliverd of these woes, True
And teaches me to kill or hang myself, True
If I were mad I should forget my son, True
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he, True

The different plague of each calamity, True
Bind up those tresses O what love I note, True
In the fair multitude of those her hairs, True
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen, True
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends, True
Do glue themselves in sociable grief, True
Like true inseparable faithful loves, True
Sticking together in calamity, True
To England if you will, True
Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it, True
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud, True
O that these hands could so redeem my son, True
As they have given these hairs their liberty, True
But now I envy at their liberty, True
And will again commit them to their bonds, True
Because my poor child is a prisoner, True
And father cardinal I have heard you say, True
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven, True
If that be true I shall see my boy again, True
For since the birth of Cain the first male child, True
To him that did but yesterday suspire, True
There was not such a gracious creature born, True
But now will cankersorrow eat my bud, True
And chase the native beauty from his cheek, True
And he will look as hollow as a ghost, True
As dim and meagre as an agues fit, True
And so hell die and rising so again, True
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven, True
I shall not know him therefore never never, True
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more, True
You hold too heinous a respect of grief, True
He talks to me that never had a son, True
You are as fond of grief as of your child, True
Grief fills the room up of my absent child, True
Lies in his bed walks up and down with me, True
Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words, True
Remembers me of all his gracious parts, True
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form, True
Then have I reason to be fond of grief, True
Fare you well had you such a loss as I, True
I could give better comfort than you do, True
I will not keep this form upon my head, True
When there is such disorder in my wit, True
O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son, True
My life my joy my food my all the world, True
My widowcomfort and my sorrows cure, True
I fear some outrage and Ill follow her, True
Theres nothing in this world can make me joy, True
Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale, True
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man, True
And bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste, True
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness, True
Before the curing of a strong disease, True
Even in the instant of repair and health, True
The fit is strongest evils that take leave, True
On their departure most of all show evil, True
What have you lost by losing of this day, True
All days of glory joy and happiness, True
If you had won it certainly you had, True
No no when Fortune means to men most good, True
She looks upon them with a threatening eye, True
Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost, True
In this which he accounts so clearly won, True
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner, True
As heartily as he is glad he hath him, True
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood, True
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit, True
For even the breath of what I mean to speak, True
Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub, True
Out of the path which shall directly lead, True
Thy foot to Englands throne and therefore mark, True
John hath seized Arthur and it cannot be, True
That whiles warm life plays in that infants veins, True
The misplaced John should entertain an hour, True
One minute nay one quiet breath of rest, True
A sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand, True
Must be as boisterously maintaind as gaind, True
And he that stands upon a slippery place, True
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up, True
That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall, True
So be it for it cannot be but so, True
But what shall I gain by young Arthurs fall, True
You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife, True
May then make all the claim that Arthur did, True
And lose it life and all as Arthur did, True
How green you are and fresh in this old world, True
John lays you plots the times conspire with you, True
For he that steeps his safety in true blood, True
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue, True
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts, True
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal, True
That none so small advantage shall step forth, True
To cheque his reign but they will cherish it, True
No natural exhalation in the sky, True
No scope of nature no distemperd day, True
No common wind no customed event, True
But they will pluck away his natural cause, True
And call them meteors prodigies and signs, True
Abortives presages and tongues of heaven, True
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John, True
May be he will not touch young Arthurs life, True
But hold himself safe in his prisonment, True
O sir when he shall hear of your approach, True
If that young Arthur be not gone already, True
Even at that news he dies and then the hearts, True
Of all his people shall revolt from him, True
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change, True
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath, True
Out of the bloody fingers ends of John, True
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot, True
And O what better matter breeds for you, True
Than I have named The bastard Faulconbridge, True
Is now in England ransacking the church, True
Offending charity if but a dozen French, True
Were there in arms they would be as a call, True
To train ten thousand English to their side, True
Or as a little snow tumbled about, True
Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin, True
Go with me to the king tis wonderful, True
What may be wrought out of their discontent, True
Now that their souls are topful of offence, True
For England go I will whet on the king, True
Strong reasons make strong actions let us go, True
If you say ay the king will not say no, True
SCENE I A room in a castle, True

Within the arras when I strike my foot, True
Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth, True
And bind the boy which you shall find with me, True
Fast to the chair be heedful hence and watch, True
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed, True
Uncleanly scruples fear not you look tot, True
Young lad come forth I have to say with you, True
Good morrow little prince, True
As little prince having so great a title, True
To be more prince as may be You are sad, True
Indeed I have been merrier, True
Methinks no body should be sad but I, True
Yet I remember when I was in France, True
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night, True
Only for wantonness By my christendom, True
So I were out of prison and kept sheep, True
I should be as merry as the day is long, True
And so I would be here but that I doubt, True
My uncle practises more harm to me, True
He is afraid of me and I of him, True
Is it my fault that I was Geffreys son, True
No indeed ist not and I would to heaven, True
I were your son so you would love me Hubert, True
Aside If I talk to him with his innocent prate, True
He will awake my mercy which lies dead, True
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch, True
Are you sick Hubert you look pale today, True
In sooth I would you were a little sick, True
That I might sit all night and watch with you, True
I warrant I love you more than you do me, True
Aside His words do take possession of my bosom, True
Read here young Arthur, True
How now foolish rheum, True
Turning dispiteous torture out of door, True
I must be brief lest resolution drop, True
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears, True
Can you not read it Is it not fair writ, True
Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect, True
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes, True
Have you the heart When your head did but ache, True
I knit my handercher about your brows, True
The best I had a princess wrought it me, True
And I did never ask it you again, True
And with my hand at midnight held your head, True
And like the watchful minutes to the hour, True
Still and anon cheerd up the heavy time, True
Saying What lack you and Where lies your grief, True
Or What good love may I perform for you, True
Many a poor mans son would have lien still, True
And neer have spoke a loving word to you, True
But you at your sick service had a prince, True
Nay you may think my love was crafty love, True
And call it cunning do an if you will, True
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill, True
Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes, True
These eyes that never did nor never shall, True
So much as frown on you, True
I have sworn to do it, True
And with hot irons must I burn them out, True
Ah none but in this iron age would do it, True
The iron of itself though heat redhot, True
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears, True
And quench his fiery indignation, True
Even in the matter of mine innocence, True
Nay after that consume away in rust, True
But for containing fire to harm mine eye, True
Are you more stubbornhard than hammerd iron, True
An if an angel should have come to me, True
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes, True
I would not have believed himno tongue but Huberts, True
Reenter Executioners with a cord irons  c, True
O save me Hubert save me my eyes are out, True
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men, True
Give me the iron I say and bind him here, True
Alas what need you be so boisterousrough, True
I will not struggle I will stand stonestill, True
For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound, True
Nay hear me Hubert drive these men away, True
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb, True
I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word, True
Nor look upon the iron angerly, True
Thrust but these men away and Ill forgive you, True
Whatever torment you do put me to, True
Go stand within let me alone with him, True
I am best pleased to be from such a deed, True
Alas I then have chid away my friend, True
He hath a stern look but a gentle heart, True
Let him come back that his compassion may, True
Come boy prepare yourself, True
None but to lose your eyes, True
O heaven that there were but a mote in yours, True
A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair, True
Any annoyance in that precious sense, True
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there, True
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible, True
Is this your promise go to hold your tongue, True
Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues, True
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes, True
Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert, True
Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue, True
So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes, True
Though to no use but still to look on you, True
Lo by my truth the instrument is cold, True
And would not harm me, True
No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief, True
Being create for comfort to be used, True
In undeserved extremes see else yourself, True
There is no malice in this burning coal, True
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out, True
And strewd repentent ashes on his head, True
But with my breath I can revive it boy, True
An if you do you will but make it blush, True
And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert, True
Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes, True
And like a dog that is compelld to fight, True
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on, True
All things that you should use to do me wrong, True
Deny their office only you do lack, True
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends, True
Creatures of note for mercylacking uses, True
Well see to live I will not touch thine eye, True
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes, True
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose boy, True
With this same very iron to burn them out, True
O now you look like Hubert all this while, True
Peace no more Adieu, True
Your uncle must not know but you are dead, True
Ill fill these dogged spies with false reports, True
And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure, True
That Hubert for the wealth of all the world, True
Will not offend thee, True
O heaven I thank you Hubert, True
Silence no more go closely in with me, True
Much danger do I undergo for thee, True
SCENE II KING JOHNS palace, True
Enter KING JOHN PEMBROKE SALISBURY and other Lords, True
Here once again we sit once again crownd, True
And looked upon I hope with cheerful eyes, True
This once again but that your highness pleased, True
Was once superfluous you were crownd before, True
And that high royalty was neer pluckd off, True
The faiths of men neer stained with revolt, True
Fresh expectation troubled not the land, True
With any longdfor change or better state, True
Therefore to be possessd with double pomp, True
To guard a title that was rich before, True
To gild refined gold to paint the lily, True
To throw a perfume on the violet, True
To smooth the ice or add another hue, True
Unto the rainbow or with taperlight, True
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish, True
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess, True
But that your royal pleasure must be done, True
This act is as an ancient tale new told, True
And in the last repeating troublesome, True
Being urged at a time unseasonable, True
In this the antique and well noted face, True
Of plain old form is much disfigured, True
And like a shifted wind unto a sail, True
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about, True
Startles and frights consideration, True
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected, True
For putting on so new a fashiond robe, True
When workmen strive to do better than well, True
They do confound their skill in covetousness, True
And oftentimes excusing of a fault, True
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse, True
As patches set upon a little breach, True
Discredit more in hiding of the fault, True
Than did the fault before it was so patchd, True
To this effect before you were new crownd, True
We breathed our counsel but it pleased your highness, True
To overbear it and we are all well pleased, True
Since all and every part of what we would, True
Doth make a stand at what your highness will, True
Some reasons of this double coronation, True
I have possessd you with and think them strong, True
And more more strong then lesser is my fear, True
I shall indue you with meantime but ask, True
What you would have reformd that is not well, True
And well shall you perceive how willingly, True
I will both hear and grant you your requests, True
Then I as one that am the tongue of these, True
To sound the purpose of all their hearts, True
Both for myself and them but chief of all, True
Your safety for the which myself and them, True
Bend their best studies heartily request, True
The enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint, True
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent, True
To break into this dangerous argument, True
If what in rest you have in right you hold, True
Why then your fears which as they say attend, True
The steps of wrong should move you to mew up, True
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days, True
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth, True
The rich advantage of good exercise, True
That the times enemies may not have this, True
To grace occasions let it be our suit, True
That you have bid us ask his liberty, True
Which for our goods we do no further ask, True
Than whereupon our weal on you depending, True
Counts it your weal he have his liberty, True
Let it be so I do commit his youth, True
To your direction Hubert what news with you, True
This is the man should do the bloody deed, True
He showd his warrant to a friend of mine, True
The image of a wicked heinous fault, True
Lives in his eye that close aspect of his, True
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast, True
And I do fearfully believe tis done, True
What we so feard he had a charge to do, True
The colour of the king doth come and go, True
Between his purpose and his conscience, True
Like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set, True
His passion is so ripe it needs must break, True
And when it breaks I fear will issue thence, True
The foul corruption of a sweet childs death, True
We cannot hold mortalitys strong hand, True
Good lords although my will to give is living, True
The suit which you demand is gone and dead, True
He tells us Arthur is deceased tonight, True
Indeed we feard his sickness was past cure, True
Indeed we heard how near his death he was, True
Before the child himself felt he was sick, True
This must be answerd either here or hence, True
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me, True
Think you I bear the shears of destiny, True
Have I commandment on the pulse of life, True
It is apparent foul play and tis shame, True
That greatness should so grossly offer it, True
So thrive it in your game and so farewell, True
Stay yet Lord Salisbury Ill go with thee, True
And find the inheritance of this poor child, True
His little kingdom of a forced grave, True
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle, True
Three foot of it doth hold bad world the while, True
This must not be thus borne this will break out, True
To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt, True
They burn in indignation I repent, True
There is no sure foundation set on blood, True
No certain life achieved by others death, True
A fearful eye thou hast where is that blood, True
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks, True
So foul a sky clears not without a storm, True
Pour down thy weather how goes all in France, True
From France to England Never such a power, True
For any foreign preparation, True
Was levied in the body of a land, True
The copy of your speed is learnd by them, True
For when you should be told they do prepare, True
The tidings come that they are all arrived, True
O where hath our intelligence been drunk, True
Where hath it slept Where is my mothers care, True
That such an army could be drawn in France, True
And she not hear of it, True
Is stoppd with dust the first of April died, True
Your noble mother and as I hear my lord, True
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died, True
Three days before but this from rumours tongue, True
I idly heard if true or false I know not, True
Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion, True
O make a league with me till I have pleased, True
My discontented peers What mother dead, True
How wildly then walks my estate in France, True
Under whose conduct came those powers of France, True
That thou for truth givest out are landed here, True
Thou hast made me giddy, True
With these ill tidings, True
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret, True
Now what says the world, True
To your proceedings do not seek to stuff, True
My head with more ill news for it is full, True
But if you be afeard to hear the worst, True
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead, True
Bear with me cousin for I was amazed, True
Under the tide but now I breathe again, True
Aloft the flood and can give audience, True
To any tongue speak it of what it will, True
How I have sped among the clergymen, True
The sums I have collected shall express, True
But as I travelld hither through the land, True
I find the people strangely fantasied, True
Possessd with rumours full of idle dreams, True
Not knowing what they fear but full of fear, True
And here a prophet that I brought with me, True
From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found, True
With many hundreds treading on his heels, True
To whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes, True
That ere the next Ascensionday at noon, True
Your highness should deliver up your crown, True
Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so, True
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so, True
Hubert away with him imprison him, True
And on that day at noon whereon he says, True
I shall yield up my crown let him be hangd, True
Deliver him to safety and return, True
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER, True
Hearst thou the news abroad who are arrived, True
The French my lord mens mouths are full of it, True
Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury, True
With eyes as red as newenkindled fire, True
And others more going to seek the grave, True
Of Arthur who they say is killd tonight, True
And thrust thyself into their companies, True
I have a way to win their loves again, True
Bring them before me, True
I will seek them out, True
Nay but make haste the better foot before, True
O let me have no subject enemies, True
When adverse foreigners affright my towns, True
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion, True
Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels, True
And fly like thought from them to me again, True
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed, True
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman, True
Go after him for he perhaps shall need, True
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers, True
With all my heart my liege, True
My lord they say five moons were seen tonight, True
Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about, True
The other four in wondrous motion, True
Old men and beldams in the streets, True
Do prophesy upon it dangerously, True
Young Arthurs death is common in their mouths, True
And when they talk of him they shake their heads, True
And whisper one another in the ear, True
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wrist, True
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action, True
With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes, True
I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus, True
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool, True
With open mouth swallowing a tailors news, True
Who with his shears and measure in his hand, True
Standing on slippers which his nimble haste, True
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet, True
Told of a many thousand warlike French, True
That were embattailed and rankd in Kent, True
Another lean unwashd artificer, True
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthurs death, True
Why seekst thou to possess me with these fears, True
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthurs death, True
Thy hand hath murderd him I had a mighty cause, True
To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him, True
No had my lord why did you not provoke me, True
It is the curse of kings to be attended, True
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant, True
To break within the bloody house of life, True
And on the winking of authority, True
To understand a law to know the meaning, True
Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns, True
More upon humour than advised respect, True
Here is your hand and seal for what I did, True
O when the last account twixt heaven and earth, True
Is to be made then shall this hand and seal, True
Witness against us to damnation, True
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds, True
Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by, True
A fellow by the hand of nature markd, True
Quoted and signd to do a deed of shame, True
This murder had not come into my mind, True
But taking note of thy abhorrd aspect, True
Finding thee fit for bloody villany, True
Apt liable to be employd in danger, True
I faintly broke with thee of Arthurs death, True
And thou to be endeared to a king, True
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince, True
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause, True
When I spake darkly what I purposed, True
Or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face, True
As bid me tell my tale in express words, True
Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off, True
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me, True
But thou didst understand me by my signs, True
And didst in signs again parley with sin, True
Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent, True
And consequently thy rude hand to act, True
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name, True
Out of my sight and never see me more, True
My nobles leave me and my state is braved, True
Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers, True
Nay in the body of this fleshly land, True
This kingdom this confine of blood and breath, True
Hostility and civil tumult reigns, True
Between my conscience and my cousins death, True
Arm you against your other enemies, True
Ill make a peace between your soul and you, True
Young Arthur is alive this hand of mine, True
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand, True
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood, True
Within this bosom never enterd yet, True
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought, True
And you have slanderd nature in my form, True
Which howsoever rude exteriorly, True
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind, True
Than to be butcher of an innocent child, True
Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers, True
Throw this report on their incensed rage, True
And make them tame to their obedience, True
Forgive the comment that my passion made, True
Upon thy feature for my rage was blind, True
And foul imaginary eyes of blood, True
Presented thee more hideous than thou art, True
O answer not but to my closet bring, True
The angry lords with all expedient haste, True
I conjure thee but slowly run more fast, True
SCENE III Before the castle, True
Enter ARTHUR on the walls, True
The wall is high and yet will I leap down, True
Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not, True
Theres few or none do know me if they did, True
This shipboys semblance hath disguised me quite, True
I am afraid and yet Ill venture it, True
If I get down and do not break my limbs, True
Ill find a thousand shifts to get away, True
As good to die and go as die and stay, True
O me my uncles spirit is in these stones, True
Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones, True
Enter PEMBROKE SALISBURY and BIGOT, True
Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury, True
It is our safety and we must embrace, True
This gentle offer of the perilous time, True
Who brought that letter from the cardinal, True
The Count Melun a noble lord of France, True
Whose private with me of the Dauphins love, True
Is much more general than these lines import, True
Tomorrow morning let us meet him then, True
Or rather then set forward for twill be, True
Two long days journey lords or ere we meet, True
Once more today well met distemperd lords, True
The king by me requests your presence straight, True
The king hath dispossessd himself of us, True
We will not line his thin bestained cloak, True
With our pure honours nor attend the foot, True
That leaves the print of blood whereer it walks, True
Return and tell him so we know the worst, True
Whateer you think good words I think were best, True
Our griefs and not our manners reason now, True
But there is little reason in your grief, True
Therefore twere reason you had manners now, True
Sir sir impatience hath his privilege, True
Tis true to hurt his master no man else, True
This is the prison What is he lies here, True
O death made proud with pure and princely beauty, True
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed, True
Murder as hating what himself hath done, True
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge, True
Or when he doomd this beauty to a grave, True
Found it too preciousprincely for a grave, True
Sir Richard what think you have you beheld, True
Or have you read or heard or could you think, True
Or do you almost think although you see, True
That you do see could thought without this object, True
Form such another This is the very top, True
The height the crest or crest unto the crest, True
Of murders arms this is the bloodiest shame, True
The wildest savagery the vilest stroke, True
That ever walleyed wrath or staring rage, True
Presented to the tears of soft remorse, True
All murders past do stand excused in this, True
And this so sole and so unmatchable, True
Shall give a holiness a purity, True
To the yet unbegotten sin of times, True
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest, True
Exampled by this heinous spectacle, True
It is a damned and a bloody work, True
The graceless action of a heavy hand, True
If that it be the work of any hand, True
If that it be the work of any hand, True
We had a kind of light what would ensue, True
It is the shameful work of Huberts hand, True
The practise and the purpose of the king, True
From whose obedience I forbid my soul, True
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life, True
And breathing to his breathless excellence, True
The incense of a vow a holy vow, True
Never to taste the pleasures of the world, True
Never to be infected with delight, True
Nor conversant with ease and idleness, True
Till I have set a glory to this hand, True
By giving it the worship of revenge, True
Our souls religiously confirm thy words, True
Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you, True
Arthur doth live the king hath sent for you, True
O he is old and blushes not at death, True
Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone, True
Your sword is bright sir put it up again, True
Not till I sheathe it in a murderers skin, True
Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say, True
By heaven I think my swords as sharp as yours, True
I would not have you lord forget yourself, True
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence, True
Lest I by marking of your rage forget, True
Your worth your greatness and nobility, True
Out dunghill darest thou brave a nobleman, True
Not for my life but yet I dare defend, True
My innocent life against an emperor, True
Yet I am none whose tongue soeer speaks false, True
Not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies, True
Keep the peace I say, True
Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge, True
Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury, True
If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot, True
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame, True
Ill strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime, True
Or Ill so maul you and your toastingiron, True
That you shall think the devil is come from hell, True
What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge, True
Second a villain and a murderer, True
Lord Bigot I am none, True
Who killd this prince, True
Tis not an hour since I left him well, True
I honourd him I loved him and will weep, True
My date of life out for his sweet lifes loss, True
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes, True
For villany is not without such rheum, True
And he long traded in it makes it seem, True
Like rivers of remorse and innocency, True
Away with me all you whose souls abhor, True
The uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse, True
For I am stifled with this smell of sin, True
Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there, True
There tell the king he may inquire us out, True
Heres a good world Knew you of this fair work, True
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach, True
Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death, True
Art thou damnd Hubert, True
Ha Ill tell thee what, True
Thourt damnd as blacknay nothing is so black, True
Thou art more deep damnd than Prince Lucifer, True
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell, True
As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child, True
If thou didst but consent, True
To this most cruel act do but despair, True
And if thou wantst a cord the smallest thread, True
That ever spider twisted from her womb, True
Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam, True
To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself, True
Put but a little water in a spoon, True
And it shall be as all the ocean, True
Enough to stifle such a villain up, True
I do suspect thee very grievously, True
If I in act consent or sin of thought, True
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath, True
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay, True
Let hell want pains enough to torture me, True
Go bear him in thine arms, True
I am amazed methinks and lose my way, True
Among the thorns and dangers of this world, True
How easy dost thou take all England up, True
From forth this morsel of dead royalty, True
The life the right and truth of all this realm, True
Is fled to heaven and England now is left, True
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth, True
The unowed interest of proudswelling state, True
Now for the barepickd bone of majesty, True
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest, True
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace, True
Now powers from home and discontents at home, True
Meet in one line and vast confusion waits, True
As doth a raven on a sickfalln beast, True
The imminent decay of wrested pomp, True
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can, True
Hold out this tempest Bear away that child, True
And follow me with speed Ill to the king, True
A thousand businesses are brief in hand, True
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land, True
SCENE I KING JOHNS palace, True
Enter KING JOHN CARDINAL PANDULPH and Attendants, True
Thus have I yielded up into your hand, True
The circle of my glory, True
From this my hand as holding of the pope, True
Your sovereign greatness and authority, True
Now keep your holy word go meet the French, True
And from his holiness use all your power, True
To stop their marches fore we are inflamed, True
Our discontented counties do revolt, True
Our people quarrel with obedience, True
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul, True
To stranger blood to foreign royalty, True
This inundation of mistemperd humour, True
Rests by you only to be qualified, True
Then pause not for the present times so sick, True
That present medicine must be ministerd, True
Or overthrow incurable ensues, True
It was my breath that blew this tempest up, True
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope, True
But since you are a gentle convertite, True
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war, True
And make fair weather in your blustering land, True
On this Ascensionday remember well, True
Upon your oath of service to the pope, True
Go I to make the French lay down their arms, True
Is this Ascensionday Did not the prophet, True
Say that before Ascensionday at noon, True
My crown I should give off Even so I have, True
I did suppose it should be on constraint, True
But heaven be thankd it is but voluntary, True
All Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out, True
But Dover castle London hath received, True
Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers, True
Your nobles will not hear you but are gone, True
To offer service to your enemy, True
And wild amazement hurries up and down, True
The little number of your doubtful friends, True
Would not my lords return to me again, True
After they heard young Arthur was alive, True
They found him dead and cast into the streets, True
An empty casket where the jewel of life, True

Away and glister like the god of war, True
When he intendeth to become the field, True

What shall they seek the lion in his den, True
And fright him there and make him tremble there, True
O let it not be said forage and run, True
To meet displeasure farther from the doors, True
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh, True
The legate of the pope hath been with me, True
And I have made a happy peace with him, True
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers, True

By making many O it grieves my soul, True
That I must draw this metal from my side, True
To be a widowmaker O and there, True
Where honourable rescue and defence, True
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury, True
But such is the infection of the time, True
That for the health and physic of our right, True
We cannot deal but with the very hand, True
Of stern injustice and confused wrong, True
And ist not pity O my grieved friends, True
That we the sons and children of this isle, True
Were born to see so sad an hour as this, True
Wherein we step after a stranger march, True
Upon her gentle bosom and fill up, True
Her enemies ranksI must withdraw and weep, True
Upon the spot of this enforced cause, True
To grace the gentry of a land remote, True
And follow unacquainted colours here, True
What here O nation that thou couldst remove, True

Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself, True
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore, True
Where these two Christian armies might combine, True

Between compulsion and a brave respect, True
Let me wipe off this honourable dew, True
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks, True
My heart hath melted at a ladys tears, True
Being an ordinary inundation, True
But this effusion of such manly drops, True
This shower blown up by tempest of the soul, True
Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed, True
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven, True
Figured quite oer with burning meteors, True
Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury, True
And with a great heart heave away the storm, True
Commend these waters to those baby eyes, True
That never saw the giant world enraged, True
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts, True
Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping, True
Come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep, True

And be no further harmful than in show, True
Your grace shall pardon me I will not back, True
I am too highborn to be propertied, True
To be a secondary at control, True
Or useful servingman and instrument, True
To any sovereign state throughout the world, True
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars, True
Between this chastised kingdom and myself, True
And brought in matter that should feed this fire, True
And now tis far too huge to be blown out, True
With that same weak wind which enkindled it, True
You taught me how to know the face of right, True
Acquainted me with interest to this land, True
Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart, True
And come ye now to tell me John hath made, True
His peace with Rome What is that peace to me, True
I by the honour of my marriagebed, True
After young Arthur claim this land for mine, True
And now it is halfconquerd must I back, True
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome, True

Before I drew this gallant head of war, True
And culld these fiery spirits from the world, True

My holy lord of Milan from the king, True
I come to learn how you have dealt for him, True
And as you answer I do know the scope, True
And warrant limited unto my tongue, True
The Dauphin is too wilfulopposite, True
And will not temporize with my entreaties, True
He flatly says hell not lay down his arms, True
By all the blood that ever fury breathed, True
The youth says well Now hear our English king, True
For thus his royalty doth speak in me, True
He is prepared and reason too he should, True
This apish and unmannerly approach, True
This harnessd masque and unadvised revel, True
This unhaird sauciness and boyish troops, True
The king doth smile at and is well prepared, True
To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms, True
From out the circle of his territories, True
That hand which had the strength even at your door, True
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch, True
To dive like buckets in concealed wells, True
To crouch in litter of your stable planks, True
To lie like pawns lockd up in chests and trunks, True
To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out, True
In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake, True
Even at the crying of your nations crow, True
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman, True
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here, True
That in your chambers gave you chastisement, True
No know the gallant monarch is in arms, True
And like an eagle oer his aery towers, True
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest, True
And you degenerate you ingrate revolts, True
You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb, True
Of your dear mother England blush for shame, True
For your own ladies and palevisaged maids, True
Like Amazons come tripping after drums, True
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change, True
Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts, True
To fierce and bloody inclination, True
There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace, True
We grant thou canst outscold us fare thee well, True
We hold our time too precious to be spent, True
With such a brabbler, True
Give me leave to speak, True
We will attend to neither, True
Strike up the drums and let the tongue of war, True
Plead for our interest and our being here, True
Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out, True
And so shall you being beaten do but start, True
An echo with the clamour of thy drum, True
And even at hand a drum is ready braced, True
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine, True
Sound but another and another shall, True
As loud as thine rattle the welkins ear, True
And mock the deepmouthd thunder for at hand, True
Not trusting to this halting legate here, True
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need, True
Is warlike John and in his forehead sits, True
A bareribbd death whose office is this day, True
To feast upon whole thousands of the French, True

Foretell the ending of mortality, True
His highness yet doth speak and holds belief, True
That being brought into the open air, True
It would allay the burning quality, True
Of that fell poison which assaileth him, True
Let him be brought into the orchard here, True
Than when you left him even now he sung, True
O vanity of sickness fierce extremes, True
In their continuance will not feel themselves, True
Death having preyd upon the outward parts, True
Leaves them invisible and his siege is now, True
Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds, True

Whi ch in their throng and press to that last hold, True
Confound themselves Tis strange that death, True
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan, True

Through my burnd bosom nor entreat the north, True
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips, True
And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much, True
I beg cold comfort and you are so strait, True
And so ingrateful you deny me that, True

Within me is a hell and there the poison, True
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize, True
On unreprievable condemned blood, True
O I am scalded with my violent motion, True
And spleen of speed to see your majesty, True
O cousin thou art come to set mine eye, True
The tackle of my heart is crackd and burnd, True
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail, True
Are turned to one thread one little hair, True

Which holds but till thy news be uttered, True
And then all this thou seest is but a clod, True
And module of confounded royalty, True
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward, True
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him, True
For in a night the best part of my power, True

Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray, True
Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him, True
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice, True
Or worthily as a good subject should, True
On some known ground of treachery in him, True
As near as I could sift him on that argument, True
On some apparent danger seen in him, True
Aimd at your highness no inveterate malice, True
Then call them to our presence face to face, True

Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object, True
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray, True
First heaven be the record to my speech, True
In the devotion of a subjects love, True
Tendering the precious safety of my prince, True
And free from other misbegotten hate, True
Come I appellant to this princely presence, True
Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee, True
And mark my greeting well for what I speak, True
My body shall make good upon this earth, True
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven, True
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant, True
Too good to be so and too bad to live, True
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, True
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly, True
Once more the more to aggravate the note, True
With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat, True
And wish so please my sovereign ere I move, True
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove, True
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal, True
Tis not the trial of a womans war, True
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, True
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain, True
The blood is hot that must be coold for this, True
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast, True
As to be hushd and nought at all to say, True
First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me, True
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech, True
Which else would post until it had returnd, True
These terms of treason doubled down his throat, True
Setting aside his high bloods royalty, True
And let him be no kinsman to my liege, True
I do defy him and I spit at him, True
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain, True
Which to maintain I would allow him odds, True
And meet him were I tied to run afoot, True
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, True
Or any other ground inhabitable, True
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot, True
Mean time let this defend my loyalty, True
By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie, True
Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage, True
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king, True
And lay aside my high bloods royalty, True
Which fear not reverence makes thee to except, True
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength, True
As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop, True
By that and all the rites of knighthood else, True
Will I make good against thee arm to arm, True
What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise, True
I take it up and by that sword I swear, True
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder, True
Ill answer thee in any fair degree, True
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial, True
And when I mount alive may I not light, True
If I be traitor or unjustly fight, True

In name of lendings for your highness soldiers, True
The which he hath detaind for lewd employments, True

Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge, True
That ever was surveyd by English eye, True
That all the treasons for these eighteen years, True
Complotted and contrived in this land, True
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring, True
Further I say and further will maintain, True
Upon his bad life to make all this good, True
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death, True
Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries, True
And consequently like a traitor coward, True
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood, True
Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries, True
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, True
To me for justice and rough chastisement, True
And by the glorious worth of my descent, True
This arm shall do it or this life be spent, True
How high a pitch his resolution soars, True
Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this, True

Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom, True
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce, True
The sly slow hours shall not determinate, True
The dateless limit of thy dear exile, True
The hopeless word of never to return, True
Breathe I against thee upon pain of life, True
A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege, True
And all unlookd for from your highness mouth, True
A dearer merit not so deep a maim, True
As to be cast forth in the common air, True
Have I deserved at your highness hands, True
The language I have learnd these forty years, True
My native English now I must forego, True
And now my tongues use is to me no more, True
Than an unstringed viol or a harp, True
Or like a cunning instrument cased up, True
Or being open put into his hands, True
That knows no touch to tune the harmony, True
Within my mouth you have engaold my tongue, True
Doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips, True
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance, True
Is made my gaoler to attend on me, True
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse, True
Too far in years to be a pupil now, True
What is thy sentence then but speechless death, True
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath, True
It boots thee not to be compassionate, True
After our sentence plaining comes too late, True
Then thus I turn me from my countrys light, True
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night, True
Return again and take an oath with thee, True
Lay on our royal sword your banishd hands, True
Swear by the duty that you owe to God, True
Our part therein we banish with yourselves, True
To keep the oath that we administer, True
You never shall so help you truth and God, True

Nor never look upon each others face, True
Nor never write regreet nor reconcile, True
This louring tempest of your homebred hate, True
Nor never by advised purpose meet, True
To plot contrive or complot any ill, True
Gainst us our state our subjects or our land, True
And I to keep all this, True
Norfolk so far as to mine enemy, True
By this time had the king permitted us, True
One of our souls had wanderd in the air, True
Banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, True
As now our flesh is banishd from this land, True
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm, True
Since thou hast far to go bear not along, True
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul, True
No Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor, True
My name be blotted from the book of life, True
And I from heaven banishd as from hence, True
But what thou art God thou and I do know, True
And all too soon I fear the king shall rue, True
Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray, True
Save back to England all the worlds my way, True
Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes, True
I see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect, True
Hath from the number of his banishd years, True
Six frozen winter spent, True
Return with welcome home from banishment, True
How long a time lies in one little word, True
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs, True
End in a word such is the breath of kings, True
I thank my liege that in regard of me, True
He shortens four years of my sons exile, True
But little vantage shall I reap thereby, True
For ere the six years that he hath to spend, True
Can change their moons and bring their times about, True
My oildried lamp and timebewasted light, True
Shall be extinct with age and endless night, True
My inch of taper will be burnt and done, True
And blindfold death not let me see my son, True
Why uncle thou hast many years to live, True
But not a minute king that thou canst give, True
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, True
And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow, True
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age, True
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage, True
Thy word is current with him for my death, True
But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath, True
Thy son is banishd upon good advice, True
Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave, True
Why at our justice seemst thou then to lour, True
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour, True
You urged me as a judge but I had rather, True
You would have bid me argue like a father, True
O had it been a stranger not my child, True
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild, True
A partial slander sought I to avoid, True
And in the sentence my own life destroyd, True
Alas I lookd when some of you should say, True
I was too strict to make mine own away, True
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue, True
Against my will to do myself this wrong, True
Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so, True
Six years we banish him and he shall go, True
Flourish Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train, True
Cousin farewell what presence must not know, True
From where you do remain let paper show, True
My lord no leave take I for I will ride, True
As far as land will let me by your side, True
O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words, True
That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends, True
I have too few to take my leave of you, True
When the tongues office should be prodigal, True
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart, True
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time, True
Joy absent grief is present for that time, True
What is six winters they are quickly gone, True
To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten, True
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure, True
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so, True
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage, True
The sullen passage of thy weary steps, True
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set, True
The precious jewel of thy home return, True
Nay rather every tedious stride I make, True
Will but remember me what a deal of world, True
I wander from the jewels that I love, True
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood, True
To foreign passages and in the end, True
Having my freedom boast of nothing else, True
But that I was a journeyman to grief, True
All places that the eye of heaven visits, True
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens, True
Teach thy necessity to reason thus, True
There is no virtue like necessity, True
Think not the king did banish thee, True
But thou the king Woe doth the heavier sit, True
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne, True
Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour, True
And not the king exiled thee or suppose, True
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air, True
And thou art flying to a fresher clime, True
Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it, True
To lie that way thou gost not whence thou comest, True
Suppose the singing birds musicians, True
The grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd, True
The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more, True
Than a delightful measure or a dance, True
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite, True
The man that mocks at it and sets it light, True
O who can hold a fire in his hand, True
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus, True
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite, True
By bare imagination of a feast, True
Or wallow naked in December snow, True
By thinking on fantastic summers heat, True
O no the apprehension of the good, True
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse, True
Fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more, True
Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore, True
Come come my son Ill bring thee on thy way, True
Had I thy youth and cause I would not stay, True
Then Englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu, True
My mother and my nurse that bears me yet, True
Whereer I wander boast of this I can, True
Though banishd yet a trueborn Englishman, True
Enter KING RICHARD II with BAGOT and GREEN at one door and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another, True
We did observe Cousin Aumerle, True
How far brought you high Hereford on his way, True
I brought high Hereford if you call him so, True
But to the next highway and there I left him, True
And say what store of parting tears were shed, True
Faith none for me except the northeast wind, True
Which then blew bitterly against our faces, True
Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance, True
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear, True
What said our cousin when you parted with him, True
And for my heart disdained that my tongue, True
Should so profane the word that taught me craft, True
To counterfeit oppression of such grief, True
That words seemd buried in my sorrows grave, True
Marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours, True
And added years to his short banishment, True
He should have had a volume of farewells, True
But since it would not he had none of me, True
He is our cousin cousin but tis doubt, True
When time shall call him home from banishment, True
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends, True
Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green, True
Observed his courtship to the common people, True
How he did seem to dive into their hearts, True
With humble and familiar courtesy, True
What reverence he did throw away on slaves, True
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles, True
And patient underbearing of his fortune, True
As twere to banish their affects with him, True
Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench, True
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well, True
And had the tribute of his supple knee, True
With Thanks my countrymen my loving friends, True
As were our England in reversion his, True
And he our subjects next degree in hope, True
Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts, True
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, True
Expedient manage must be made my liege, True
Ere further leisure yield them further means, True
For their advantage and your highness loss, True
We will ourself in person to this war, True
And for our coffers with too great a court, True
And liberal largess are grown somewhat light, True
We are inforced to farm our royal realm, True
The revenue whereof shall furnish us, True
For our affairs in hand if that come short, True
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters, True
Whereto when they shall know what men are rich, True
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold, True
And send them after to supply our wants, True
For we will make for Ireland presently, True
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord, True
Suddenly taken and hath sent post haste, True
To entreat your majesty to visit him, True
Now put it God in the physicians mind, True
To help him to his grave immediately, True
The lining of his coffers shall make coats, True
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars, True
Come gentlemen lets all go visit him, True
Pray God we may make haste and come too late, True
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick with the DUKE OF YORK  c, True
Will the king come that I may breathe my last, True
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth, True
Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath, True
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear, True
O but they say the tongues of dying men, True
Enforce attention like deep harmony, True
Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain, True
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain, True
He that no more must say is listend more, True
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose, True
More are mens ends markd than their lives before, True
The setting sun and music at the close, True
As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last, True
Writ in remembrance more than things long past, True
Though Richard my lifes counsel would not hear, True
My deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear, True
No it is stoppd with other flattering sounds, True
As praises of whose taste the wise are fond, True
Lascivious metres to whose venom sound, True
The open ear of youth doth always listen, True
Report of fashions in proud Italy, True
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation, True
Limps after in base imitation, True
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity, True
So it be new theres no respect how vile, True
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears, True
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard, True
Where will doth mutiny with wits regard, True
Direct not him whose way himself will choose, True
Tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose, True
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired, True
And thus expiring do foretell of him, True
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, True
For violent fires soon burn out themselves, True
Small showers last long but sudden storms are short, True
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes, True
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder, True
Light vanity insatiate cormorant, True
Consuming means soon preys upon itself, True
This royal throne of kings this scepterd isle, True
This earth of majesty this seat of Mars, True
This other Eden demiparadise, True
This fortress built by Nature for herself, True
Against infection and the hand of war, True
This happy breed of men this little world, True
This precious stone set in the silver sea, True
Which serves it in the office of a wall, True
Or as a moat defensive to a house, True
Against the envy of less happier lands, True
This blessed plot this earth this realm this England, True
This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings, True
Feard by their breed and famous by their birth, True
Renowned for their deeds as far from home, True
For Christian service and true chivalry, True
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, True
Of the worlds ransom blessed Marys Son, True
This land of such dear souls this dear dear land, True
Dear for her reputation through the world, True
Is now leased out I die pronouncing it, True
Like to a tenement or pelting farm, True
England bound in with the triumphant sea, True

If that thy valour stand on sympathy, True
There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine, True
By that fair sun which shows me where thou standst, True
I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it, True
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucesters death, True
If thou denyst it twenty times thou liest, True
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart, True
Where it was forged with my rapiers point, True
Thou darest not coward live to see that day, True
Now by my soul I would it were this hour, True

And that thou art so there I throw my gage, True
To prove it on thee to the extremest point, True
Of mortal breathing seize it if thou darest, True
An if I do not may my hands rot off, True
And never brandish more revengeful steel, True
Over the glittering helmet of my foe, True
I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle, True
And spur thee on with full as many lies, True
As may be holload in thy treacherous ear, True

The very time Aumerle and you did talk, True
Tis very true you were in presence then, True
And you can witness with me this is true, True
As false by heaven as heaven itself is true, True
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword, True
That it shall render vengeance and revenge, True
Till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie, True
In earth as quiet as thy fathers skull, True
In proof whereof there is my honours pawn, True
Engage it to the trial if thou darest, True
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse, True
If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live, True
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness, True
And spit upon him whilst I say he lies, True
And lies and lies there is my bond of faith, True
To tie thee to my strong correction, True
As I intend to thrive in this new world, True
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal, True
Besides I heard the banishd Norfolk say, True
That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men, True
To execute the noble duke at Calais, True
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage, True
That Norfolk lies here do I throw down this, True

Anointed crowned planted many years, True
Be judged by subject and inferior breath, True

Stirrd up by God thus boldly for his king, True
My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king, True
Is a foul traitor to proud Herefords king, True
And if you crown him let me prophesy, True
The blood of English shall manure the ground, True
And future ages groan for this foul act, True
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels, True
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars, True
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound, True
Disorder horror fear and mutiny, True
Shall here inhabit and this land be calld, True
The field of Golgotha and dead mens skulls, True

That bucket down and full of tears am I, True
Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high, True
I thought you had been willing to resign, True
My crown I am but still my griefs are mine, True
You may my glories and my state depose, True
But not my griefs still am I king of those, True
Part of your cares you give me with your crown, True

God save King Harry unkingd Richard says, True
And send him many years of sunshine days, True
No more but that you read, True
These accusations and these grievous crimes, True
Committed by your person and your followers, True
Against the state and profit of this land, True
That by confessing them the souls of men, True
May deem that you are worthily deposed, True
Must I do so and must I ravel out, True
My weavedup folly Gentle Northumberland, True
If thy offences were upon record, True
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop, True
To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst, True
There shouldst thou find one heinous article, True
Containing the deposing of a king, True
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath, True
Markd with a blot damnd in the book of heaven, True
Nay all of you that stand and look upon, True
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself, True
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands, True
Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates, True
Have here deliverd me to my sour cross, True
And water cannot wash away your sin, True
My lord dispatch read oer these articles, True
Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see, True
And yet salt water blinds them not so much, True
But they can see a sort of traitors here, True
Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself, True
I find myself a traitor with the rest, True
For I have given here my souls consent, True
To undeck the pompous body of a king, True
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave, True
Proud majesty a subject state a peasant, True
No lord of thine thou haught insulting man, True
Nor no mans lord I have no name no title, True
No not that name was given me at the font, True
But tis usurpd alack the heavy day, True
That I have worn so many winters out, True
And know not now what name to call myself, True
O that I were a mockery king of snow, True
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke, True
To melt myself away in waterdrops, True
Good king great king and yet not greatly good, True
An if my word be sterling yet in England, True
Let it command a mirror hither straight, True
That it may show me what a face I have, True
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty, True
Go some of you and fetch a lookingglass, True
Read oer this paper while the glass doth come, True
Fiend thou tormentst me ere I come to hell, True
Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland, True

When I do see the very book indeed, True
Where all my sins are writ and thats myself, True
Reenter Attendant with a glass, True
Give me the glass and therein will I read, True
No deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck, True
So many blows upon this face of mine, True
And made no deeper wounds O flattering glass, True
Like to my followers in prosperity, True
Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face, True
That every day under his household roof, True
Did keep ten thousand men was this the face, True
That like the sun did make beholders wink, True
Was this the face that faced so many follies, True
And was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke, True
A brittle glory shineth in this face, True
As brittle as the glory is the face, True
Dashes the glass against the ground, True
For there it is crackd in a hundred shivers, True
Mark silent king the moral of this sport, True
How soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face, True
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyd, True
The shadow or your face, True
The shadow of my sorrow ha lets see, True
Tis very true my grief lies all within, True
And these external manners of laments, True
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief, True
That swells with silence in the tortured soul, True
There lies the substance and I thank thee king, True
For thy great bounty that not only givest, True
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way, True
How to lament the cause Ill beg one boon, True
And then be gone and trouble you no more, True
Name it fair cousin, True
Fair cousin I am greater than a king, True
For when I was a king my flatterers, True
Were then but subjects being now a subject, True
I have a king here to my flatterer, True
Being so great I have no need to beg, True
Then give me leave to go, True
Whither you will so I were from your sights, True

You holy clergymen is there no plot, True
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot, True
Before I freely speak my mind herein, True
You shall not only take the sacrament, True
To bury mine intents but also to effect, True
Whatever I shall happen to devise, True

And wash him fresh again with truelove tears, True
Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand, True
Thou map of honour thou King Richards tomb, True
And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn, True
Why should hardfavourd grief be lodged in thee, True
When triumph is become an alehouse guest, True
Join not with grief fair woman do not so, True
To make my end too sudden learn good soul, True
To think our former state a happy dream, True
From which awaked the truth of what we are, True
Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet, True
To grim Necessity and he and I, True
Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France, True
And cloister thee in some religious house, True
Our holy lives must win a new worlds crown, True
Which our profane hours here have stricken down, True
What is my Richard both in shape and mind, True
Transformd and weakend hath Bolingbroke deposed, True
Thine intellect hath he been in thy heart, True
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw, True
And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage, True
To be oerpowerd and wilt thou pupillike, True
Take thy correction mildly kiss the rod, True
And fawn on rage with base humility, True
Which art a lion and a king of beasts, True
A king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts, True
I had been still a happy king of men, True
Good sometime queen prepare thee hence for France, True
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest, True
As from my deathbed thy last living leave, True
In winters tedious nights sit by the fire, True
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales, True
Of woeful ages long ago betid, True
And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs, True
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me, True
And send the hearers weeping to their beds, True
For why the senseless brands will sympathize, True
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue, True
And in compassion weep the fire out, True
And some will mourn in ashes some coalblack, True
For the deposing of a rightful king, True
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others, True
My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed, True
You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower, True
And madam there is order taen for you, True
With all swift speed you must away to France, True
Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal, True
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne, True
The time shall not be many hours of age, True
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head, True
Shalt break into corruption thou shalt think, True
Though he divide the realm and give thee half, True
It is too little helping him to all, True
And he shall think that thou which knowst the way, True
To plant unrightful kings wilt know again, True
Being neer so little urged another way, True
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne, True
The love of wicked men converts to fear, True
That fear to hate and hate turns one or both, True
To worthy danger and deserved death, True
My guilt be on my head and there an end, True
Take leave and part for you must part forthwith, True
Doubly divorced Bad men you violate, True

Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime, True
My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp, True
She came adorned hither like sweet May, True
Sent back like Hallowmas or shortst of day, True
And must we be divided must we part, True
Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart, True
Banish us both and send the king with me, True
That were some love but little policy, True
Then whither he goes thither let me go, True
So two together weeping make one woe, True
Weep thou for me in France I for thee here, True
Better far off than near be neer the near, True
Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans, True
So longest way shall have the longest moans, True
Twice for one step Ill groan the way being short, True
And piece the way out with a heavy heart, True
Come come in wooing sorrow lets be brief, True
Since wedding it there is such length in grief, True
One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part, True
Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart, True
Give me mine own again twere no good part, True
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart, True
So now I have mine own again be gone, True
That I might strive to kill it with a groan, True
We make woe wanton with this fond delay, True
Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say, True

My lord you told me you would tell the rest, True
When weeping made you break the story off, True
of our two cousins coming into London, True
At that sad stop my lord, True
Where rude misgovernd hands from windows tops, True
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head, True
Then as I said the duke great Bolingbroke, True
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed, True
Which his aspiring rider seemd to know, True
With slow but stately pace kept on his course, True
Whilst all tongues cried God save thee, True
You would have thought the very windows spake, True
So many greedy looks of young and old, True
Through casements darted their desiring eyes, True
Upon his visage and that all the walls, True
With painted imagery had said at once, True
Jesu preserve thee welcome Bolingbroke, True
Whilst he from the one side to the other turning, True
Bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck, True
Bespake them thus I thank you countrymen, True
And thus still doing thus he passd along, True
Alack poor Richard where rode he the whilst, True
As in a theatre the eyes of men, True
After a wellgraced actor leaves the stage, True
Are idly bent on him that enters next, True
Thinking his prattle to be tedious, True
Even so or with much more contempt mens eyes, True
Did scowl on gentle Richard no man cried God save him, True
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home, True
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head, True
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, True
His face still combating with tears and smiles, True
The badges of his grief and patience, True
That had not God for some strong purpose steeld, True
The hearts of men they must perforce have melted, True
And barbarism itself have pitied him, True
But heaven hath a hand in these events, True
To whose high will we bound our calm contents, True
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now, True
Whose state and honour I for aye allow, True
Here comes my son Aumerle, True

I will be satisfied let me see the writing, True
I do beseech your grace to pardon me, True
It is a matter of small consequence, True
Which for some reasons I would not have seen, True
Which for some reasons sir I mean to see, True
What should you fear, True
Tis nothing but some bond that he is enterd into, True
For gay apparel gainst the triumph day, True
Bound to himself what doth he with a bond, True
That he is bound to Wife thou art a fool, True
Boy let me see the writing, True

Have we more sons or are we like to have, True
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time, True
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age, True
And rob me of a happy mothers name, True
Is he not like thee is he not thine own, True
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy, True
A dozen of them here have taen the sacrament, True
And interchangeably set down their hands, True
To kill the king at Oxford, True
Well keep him here then what is that to him, True
Away fond woman were he twenty times my son, True
Hadst thou groand for him, True
As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful, True
But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect, True
That I have been disloyal to thy bed, True
And that he is a bastard not thy son, True
Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind, True
He is as like thee as a man may be, True
Not like to me or any of my kin, True
Make way unruly woman, True
After Aumerle mount thee upon his horse, True

With unrestrained loose companions, True
Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes, True
And beat our watch and rob our passengers, True
Which he young wanton and effeminate boy, True
Takes on the point of honour to support, True
My lord some two days since I saw the prince, True
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford, True
And what said the gallant, True
His answer was he would unto the stews, True
And from the commonst creature pluck a glove, True
And wear it as a favour and with that, True
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger, True
As dissolute as desperate yet through both, True
I see some sparks of better hope which elder years, True
May happily bring forth But who comes here, True

O heinous strong and bold conspiracy, True
O loyal father of a treacherous son, True
Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain, True
From when this stream through muddy passages, True
Hath held his current and defiled himself, True
Thy overflow of good converts to bad, True
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse, True
This deadly blot in thy digressing son, True
So shall my virtue be his vices bawd, True
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame, True
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold, True

And if thy poor devoted suppliant may, True
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand, True

And made her widow to a woful bed, True
On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety, True
On me that halt and am unshapen thus, True

The lips of those that breathe them in the air, True
Ill not believe but they ascend the sky, True
And there awake Gods gentlesleeping peace, True
O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog, True
Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites, True

I cannot blame her by Gods holy mother, True
She hath had too much wrong and I repent, True
My part thereof that I have done to her, True
I never did her any to my knowledge, True
But you have all the vantage of her wrong, True
I was too hot to do somebody good, True
That is too cold in thinking of it now, True
Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid, True
He is frankd up to fatting for his pains, True
God pardon them that are the cause of it, True
A virtuous and a Christianlike conclusion, True
To pray for them that have done scathe to us, True

Madam his majesty doth call for you, True
And for your grace and you my noble lords, True
Catesby we come Lords will you go with us, True
Madam we will attend your grace, True
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, True
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl, True
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach, True
I lay unto the grievous charge of others, True
Clarence whom I indeed have laid in darkness, True
I do beweep to many simple gulls, True
Namely to Hastings Derby Buckingham, True
And say it is the queen and her allies, True
That stir the king against the duke my brother, True
Now they believe it and withal whet me, True
To be revenged on Rivers Vaughan Grey, True
But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture, True
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil, True
And thus I clothe my naked villany, True
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ, True
And seem a saint when most I play the devil, True
But soft here come my executioners, True
How now my hardy stout resolved mates, True
Are you now going to dispatch this deed, True
We are my lord and come to have the warrant, True
That we may be admitted where he is, True
Well thought upon I have it here about me, True
When you have done repair to Crosby Place, True
But sirs be sudden in the execution, True
Withal obdurate do not hear him plead, True
For Clarence is wellspoken and perhaps, True
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him, True
Fear not my lord we will not stand to prate, True
Talkers are no good doers be assured, True
We come to use our hands and not our tongues, True
Your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears, True
I like you lads about your business straight, True
We will my noble lord, True
SCENE IV London The Tower, True
Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY, True
Why looks your grace so heavily today, True
O I have passd a miserable night, True
So full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams, True
That as I am a Christian faithful man, True
I would not spend another such a night, True
Though twere to buy a world of happy days, True
So full of dismal terror was the time, True
What was your dream I long to hear you tell it, True
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower, True
And was embarkd to cross to Burgundy, True
And in my company my brother Gloucester, True
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk, True
Upon the hatches thence we looked toward England, True
And cited up a thousand fearful times, True
During the wars of York and Lancaster, True
That had befalln us As we paced along, True
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, True
Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling, True
Struck me that thought to stay him overboard, True
Into the tumbling billows of the main, True
Lord Lord methought what pain it was to drown, True
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears, True
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes, True
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks, True
Ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon, True
Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl, True
Inestimable stones unvalued jewels, True
All scatterd in the bottom of the sea, True
Some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes, True
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept, True
As twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems, True
Which wood the slimy bottom of the deep, True
And mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by, True
Had you such leisure in the time of death, True
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep, True
Methought I had and often did I strive, True
To yield the ghost but still the envious flood, True
Kept in my soul and would not let it forth, True
To seek the empty vast and wandering air, True
But smotherd it within my panting bulk, True
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea, True
Awaked you not with this sore agony, True
O no my dream was lengthend after life, True
O then began the tempest to my soul, True
Who passd methought the melancholy flood, True
With that grim ferryman which poets write of, True
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night, True
The first that there did greet my stranger soul, True
Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick, True
Who cried aloud What scourge for perjury, True
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence, True
And so he vanishd then came wandering by, True
A shadow like an angel with bright hair, True
Dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud, True
Clarence is come false fleeting perjured Clarence, True
That stabbd me in the field by Tewksbury, True
Seize on him Furies take him to your torments, True
With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends, True
Environd me about and howled in mine ears, True
Such hideous cries that with the very noise, True
I trembling waked and for a season after, True
Could not believe but that I was in hell, True
Such terrible impression made the dream, True
No marvel my lord though it affrighted you, True
I promise I am afraid to hear you tell it, True
O Brakenbury I have done those things, True
Which now bear evidence against my soul, True
For Edwards sake and see how he requites me, True
O God if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, True
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, True
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone, True
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children, True
I pray thee gentle keeper stay by me, True
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep, True
I will my lord God give your grace good rest, True
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, True
Makes the night morning and the noontide night, True
Princes have but their tides for their glories, True
An outward honour for an inward toil, True
And for unfelt imagination, True
They often feel a world of restless cares, True
So that betwixt their tides and low names, True
Theres nothing differs but the outward fame, True
Enter the two Murderers, True
In Gods name what are you and how came you hither, True
I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs, True
Yea are you so brief, True
O sir it is better to be brief than tedious Show, True
him our commission talk no more, True
I am in this commanded to deliver, True
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands, True
I will not reason what is meant hereby, True
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning, True
Here are the keys there sits the duke asleep, True
Ill to the king and signify to him, True
That thus I have resignd my charge to you, True
Do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well, True
What shall we stab him as he sleeps, True
No then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes, True
When he wakes why fool he shall never wake till, True
Why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping, True
The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind, True
What art thou afraid, True
Not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be, True
damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us, True
I thought thou hadst been resolute, True
So I am to let him live, True
Back to the Duke of Gloucester tell him so, True
I pray thee stay a while I hope my holy humour, True
will change twas wont to hold me but while one, True
How dost thou feel thyself now, True
Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet, True
Remember our reward when the deed is done, True
Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward, True
Where is thy conscience now, True
In the Duke of Gloucesters purse, True
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, True
thy conscience flies out, True
Let it go theres few or none will entertain it, True
How if it come to thee again, True
Ill not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it, True
makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it, True
accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him, True
he cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it, True
detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that, True
mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of, True
obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold, True
that I found it beggars any man that keeps it it, True
is turned out of all towns and cities for a, True
dangerous thing and every man that means to live, True
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live, True
Zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me, True
not to kill the duke, True
Take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he, True
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh, True
Tut I am strongframed he cannot prevail with me, True
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his, True
reputation Come shall we to this gear, True
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy, True
sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt, True
O excellent devise make a sop of him, True
Hark he stirs shall I strike, True
No first lets reason with him, True
Where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine, True
You shall have wine enough my lord anon, True
In Gods name what art thou, True
But not as I am royal, True
Nor you as we are loyal, True
Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble, True
My voice is now the kings my looks mine own, True
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak, True
Your eyes do menace me why look you pale, True
Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come, True
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, True
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it, True
Wherein my friends have I offended you, True
Offended us you have not but the king, True
I shall be reconciled to him again, True
Never my lord therefore prepare to die, True

And lived by looking on his images, True
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance, True
Are crackd in pieces by malignant death, True
And I for comfort have but one false glass, True
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him, True
Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother, True

But death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms, True
And pluckd two crutches from my feeble limbs, True
Edward and Clarence O what cause have I, True

For it requires the royal debt it lent you, True

Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetchd, True
Hither to London to be crownd our king, True
Why with some little train my Lord of Buckingham, True
Marry my lord lest by a multitude, True
The newheald wound of malice should break out, True
Which would be so much the more dangerous, True
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd, True
Where every horse bears his commanding rein, True
And may direct his course as please himself, True
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent, True
In my opinion ought to be prevented, True
I hope the king made peace with all of us, True
And the compact is firm and true in me, True
And so in me and so I think in all, True
Yet since it is but green it should be put, True
To no apparent likelihood of breach, True
Which haply by much company might be urged, True

Stood the state so No no good friends God wot, True
For then this land was famously enrichd, True
With politic grave counsel then the king, True
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace, True
Why so hath this both by the father and mother, True

For emulation now who shall be nearest, True
Will touch us all too near if God prevent not, True
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester, True

Before the times of change still is it so, True
By a divine instinct mens minds mistrust, True

To those whose dealings have deserved the place, True
And those who have the wit to claim the place, True
This prince hath neither claimd it nor deserved it, True

Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights, True
So it should seem by that I have to say, True
First he commends him to your noble lordship, True
And then he sends you word, True
He dreamt tonight the boar had razed his helm, True
Besides he says there are two councils held, True
And that may be determined at the one, True
which may make you and him to rue at the other, True
Therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure, True
If presently you will take horse with him, True
And with all speed post with him toward the north, True
To shun the danger that his soul divines, True
Go fellow go return unto thy lord, True
Bid him not fear the separated councils, True
His honour and myself are at the one, True
And at the other is my servant Catesby, True
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us, True
Whereof I shall not have intelligence, True
Tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance, True
And for his dreams I wonder he is so fond, True
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers, True
To fly the boar before the boar pursues, True
Were to incense the boar to follow us, True
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase, True
Go bid thy master rise and come to me, True

But that Ill give my voice on Richards side, True
To bar my masters heirs in true descent, True
God knows I will not do it to the death, True

With some men else who think themselves as safe, True

Come come have with you Wot you what my lord, True

Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour, True
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word, True
And then begin again and stop again, True
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror, True
Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian, True
Speak and look back and pry on every side, True
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, True
Intending deep suspicion ghastly looks, True
Are at my service like enforced smiles, True
And both are ready in their offices, True

Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF with HASTINGS head, True
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, True
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings, True
So dear I loved the man that I must weep, True
I took him for the plainest harmless creature, True
That breathed upon this earth a Christian, True
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded, True
The history of all her secret thoughts, True
So smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue, True
That his apparent open guilt omitted, True
I mean his conversation with Shores wife, True
He lived from all attainder of suspect, True
Well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor, True
Would you imagine or almost believe, True
Weret not that by great preservation, True
We live to tell it you the subtle traitor, True
This day had plotted in the councilhouse, True
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester, True
What think You we are Turks or infidels, True
Or that we would against the form of law, True
Proceed thus rashly to the villains death, True
But that the extreme peril of the case, True
The peace of England and our persons safety, True
Enforced us to this execution, True
Now fair befall you he deserved his death, True
And you my good lords both have well proceeded, True
To warn false traitors from the like attempts, True
I never lookd for better at his hands, True
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore, True
Yet had not we determined he should die, True
Until your lordship came to see his death, True
Which now the loving haste of these our friends, True
Somewhat against our meaning have prevented, True
Because my lord we would have had you heard, True
The traitor speak and timorously confess, True
The manner and the purpose of his treason, True
That you might well have signified the same, True
Unto the citizens who haply may, True
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death, True
But my good lord your graces word shall serve, True
As well as I had seen and heard him speak, True
And doubt you not right noble princes both, True
But Ill acquaint our duteous citizens, True
With all your just proceedings in this cause, True
And to that end we wishd your lordship here, True
To avoid the carping censures of the world, True
But since you come too late of our intents, True
Yet witness what you hear we did intend, True
And so my good lord mayor we bid farewell, True
Go after after cousin Buckingham, True
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post, True
There at your meetst advantage of the time, True
Infer the bastardy of Edwards children, True
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen, True
Only for saying he would make his son, True
Heir to the crown meaning indeed his house, True
Which by the sign thereof was termed so, True
Moreover urge his hateful luxury, True
And bestial appetite in change of lust, True
Which stretched to their servants daughters wives, True
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart, True
Without control listed to make his prey, True
Nay for a need thus far come near my person, True
Tell them when that my mother went with child, True
Of that unsatiate Edward noble York, True
My princely father then had wars in France, True
And by just computation of the time, True
Found that the issue was not his begot, True
Which well appeared in his lineaments, True
Being nothing like the noble duke my father, True
But touch this sparingly as twere far off, True
Because you know my lord my mother lives, True
Fear not my lord Ill play the orator, True
As if the golden fee for which I plead, True
Were for myself and so my lord adieu, True
If you thrive well bring them to Baynards Castle, True
Where you shall find me well accompanied, True
With reverend fathers and welllearned bishops, True
I go and towards three or four oclock, True
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords, True
Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw, True
Go thou to Friar Penker bid them both, True
Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle, True
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, True
Now will I in to take some privy order, True
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, True
And to give notice that no manner of person, True
At any time have recourse unto the princes, True
Enter a Scrivener with a paper in his hand, True
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, True
Which in a set hand fairly is engrossd, True
That it may be this day read over in Pauls, True
And mark how well the sequel hangs together, True
Eleven hours I spent to write it over, True
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me, True
The precedent was full as long adoing, True
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings, True
Untainted unexamined free at liberty, True
Heres a good world the while Why whos so gross, True
That seeth not this palpable device, True
Yet whos so blind but says he sees it not, True
Bad is the world and all will come to nought, True
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought, True
SCENE VII Baynards Castle, True
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM at several doors, True
How now my lord what say the citizens, True
Now by the holy mother of our Lord, True
The citizens are mum and speak not a word, True
Touchd you the bastardy of Edwards children, True
I did with his contract with Lady Lucy, True
And his contract by deputy in France, True
The insatiate greediness of his desires, True
And his enforcement of the city wives, True
His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy, True
As being got your father then in France, True
His resemblance being not like the duke, True
Withal I did infer your lineaments, True
Being the right idea of your father, True
Both in your form and nobleness of mind, True
Laid open all your victories in Scotland, True
Your dicipline in war wisdom in peace, True
Your bounty virtue fair humility, True
Indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose, True
Untouchd or slightly handled in discourse, True
And when mine oratory grew to an end, True
I bid them that did love their countrys good, True
Cry God save Richard Englands royal king, True
No so God help me they spake not a word, True
But like dumb statues or breathing stones, True
Gazed each on other and lookd deadly pale, True
Which when I saw I reprehended them, True
And askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence, True
His answer was the people were not wont, True
To be spoke to but by the recorder, True
Then he was urged to tell my tale again, True
Thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd, True
But nothing spake in warrant from himself, True
When he had done some followers of mine own, True
At the lower end of the hall hurld up their caps, True
And some ten voices cried God save King Richard, True
And thus I took the vantage of those few, True
Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I, True
This general applause and loving shout, True
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard, True
And even here brake off and came away, True
What tongueless blocks were they would not they speak, True
No by my troth my lord, True
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come, True
The mayor is here at hand intend some fear, True
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit, True
And look you get a prayerbook in your hand, True
And stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord, True
For on that ground Ill build a holy descant, True
And be not easily won to our request, True
Play the maids part still answer nay and take it, True
I go and if you plead as well for them, True
As I can say nay to thee for myself, True
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue, True
Go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks, True
Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens, True
Welcome my lord I dance attendance here, True
I think the duke will not be spoke withal, True
Here comes his servant how now Catesby, True
My lord he doth entreat your grace, True
To visit him tomorrow or next day, True
He is within with two right reverend fathers, True
Divinely bent to meditation, True
And no worldly suit would he be moved, True
To draw him from his holy exercise, True
Return good Catesby to thy lord again, True
Tell him myself the mayor and citizens, True
In deep designs and matters of great moment, True
No less importing than our general good, True
Are come to have some conference with his grace, True
Ill tell him what you say my lord, True
Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward, True
He is not lolling on a lewd daybed, True
But on his knees at meditation, True
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans, True
But meditating with two deep divines, True
Not sleeping to engross his idle body, True
But praying to enrich his watchful soul, True
Happy were England would this gracious prince, True
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof, True
But sure I fear we shall neer win him to it, True
Marry God forbid his grace should say us nay, True
How now Catesby what says your lord, True
He wonders to what end you have assembled, True
Such troops of citizens to speak with him, True
His grace not being warnd thereof before, True
My lord he fears you mean no good to him, True
Sorry I am my noble cousin should, True
Suspect me that I mean no good to him, True
By heaven I come in perfect love to him, True
And so once more return and tell his grace, True
When holy and devout religious men, True
Are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence, True
So sweet is zealous contemplation, True
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft between two Bishops CATESBY returns, True
See where he stands between two clergymen, True

But leaving this what is your graces pleasure, True
Even that I hope which pleaseth God above, True
And all good men of this ungovernd isle, True

The supreme seat the throne majestical, True
The scepterd office of your ancestors, True
Your state of fortune and your due of birth, True
The lineal glory of your royal house, True
To the corruption of a blemished stock, True
Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, True
Which here we waken to our countrys good, True
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs, True

Then good my lord take to your royal self, True
This profferd benefit of dignity, True

My lord your promise for the earldom, True
Richmond When last I was at Exeter, True
The mayor in courtesy showd me the castle, True

To do this ruthless piece of butchery, True
Although they were fleshd villains bloody dogs, True
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion, True
Wept like two children in their deaths sad stories, True
Lo thus quoth Dighton lay those tender babes, True

Which in their summer beauty kissd each other, True
A book of prayers on their pillow lay, True

I calld thee then poor shadow painted queen, True
The presentation of but what I was, True
The flattering index of a direful pageant, True
One heaved ahigh to be hurld down below, True
A mother only mockd with two sweet babes, True
A dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble, True
A sign of dignity a garish flag, True
To be the aim of every dangerous shot, True
A queen in jest only to fill the scene, True
Where is thy husband now where be thy brothers, True
Where are thy children wherein dost thou joy, True
Who sues to thee and cries God save the queen, True

Decline all this and see what now thou art, True
For happy wife a most distressed widow, True
For joyful mother one that wails the name, True
For queen a very caitiff crownd with care, True
For one being sued to one that humbly sues, True
For one that scornd at me now scornd of me, True
For one being feard of all now fearing one, True
For one commanding all obeyd of none, True

Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous, True
Thy age confirmd proud subdued bloody, True
More mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred, True
What comfortable hour canst thou name, True
That ever graced me in thy company, True
Faith none but Humphrey Hour that calld, True
To breakfast once forth of my company, True
If I be so disgracious in your sight, True
Let me march on and not offend your grace, True
I prithee hear me speak, True
You speak too bitterly, True
For I shall never speak to thee again, True
Either thou wilt die by Gods just ordinance, True
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, True
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish, True
And never look upon thy face again, True
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse, True
Which in the day of battle tire thee more, True
Than all the complete armour that thou wearst, True
My prayers on the adverse party fight, True
And there the little souls of Edwards children, True
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies, True
And promise them success and victory, True
Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end, True
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend, True
Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse, True

So she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter, True
I will confess she was not Edwards daughter, True
Wrong not her birth she is of royal blood, True
To save her life Ill say she is not so, True
Her life is only safest in her birth, True
And only in that safety died her brothers, True
Lo at their births good stars were opposite, True
No to their lives bad friends were contrary, True
All unavoided is the doom of destiny, True
True when avoided grace makes destiny, True
My babes were destined to a fairer death, True
If grace had blessd thee with a fairer life, True
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins, True
Cousins indeed and by their uncle cozend, True
Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life, True
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, True
Thy head all indirectly gave direction, True
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt, True
Till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart, True
To revel in the entrails of my lambs, True
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, True
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys, True
Till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes, True
And I in such a desperate bay of death, True
Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, True
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom, True

Last longer telling than thy kindness date, True
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter, True
My daughters mother thinks it with her soul, True

Unless thou couldst put on some other shape, True
And not be Richard that hath done all this, True
Say that I did all this for love of her, True
Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, True
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil, True
Look what is done cannot be now amended, True
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, True
Which after hours give leisure to repent, True

To quicken your increase I will beget, True
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter, True
A grandams name is little less in love, True

Even of your mettle of your very blood, True
Of an one pain save for a night of groans, True
Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow, True
Your children were vexation to your youth, True

SCENE I Rome Before the Palace, True
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus top, True
Safe out of fortunes shot and sits aloft, True
Secure of thunders crack or lightning flash, True
Advanced above pale envys threatening reach, True
As when the golden sun salutes the morn, True
And having gilt the ocean with his beams, True
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach, True
And overlooks the highestpeering hills, True
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait, True
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown, True
Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts, True
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress, True
And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long, True
Hast prisoner held fetterd in amorous chains, True
And faster bound to Aarons charming eyes, True
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus, True
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts, True
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold, True
To wait upon this newmade empress, True
To wait said I to wanton with this queen, True
This goddess this Semiramis this nymph, True
This siren that will charm Romes Saturnine, True
And see his shipwreck and his commonweals, True
Holloa what storm is this, True
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON braving, True
Chiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edge, True
And manners to intrude where I am graced, True
And may for aught thou knowst affected be, True
Demetrius thou dost overween in all, True
And so in this to bear me down with braves, True
Tis not the difference of a year or two, True
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate, True
I am as able and as fit as thou, True
To serve and to deserve my mistress grace, True
And that my sword upon thee shall approve, True
And plead my passions for Lavinias love, True
Aside Clubs clubs these lovers will not keep, True
Why boy although our mother unadvised, True
Gave you a dancingrapier by your side, True
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends, True
Go to have your lath glued within your sheath, True
Till you know better how to handle it, True
Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have, True
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare, True
Ay boy grow ye so brave, True
Coming forward Why how now lords, True
So near the emperors palace dare you draw, True
And maintain such a quarrel openly, True
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge, True
I would not for a million of gold, True
The cause were known to them it most concerns, True
Nor would your noble mother for much more, True
Be so dishonourd in the court of Rome, True
Not I till I have sheathed, True
My rapier in his bosom and withal, True
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat, True
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here, True
For that I am prepared and full resolved, True
Foulspoken coward that thunderst with thy tongue, True
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform, True
Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore, True
This petty brabble will undo us all, True
Why lords and think you not how dangerous, True
It is to jet upon a princes right, True
What is Lavinia then become so loose, True
Or Bassianus so degenerate, True
That for her love such quarrels may be broachd, True
Without controlment justice or revenge, True
Young lords beware and should the empress know, True
This discords ground the music would not please, True
I care not I knew she and all the world, True
I love Lavinia more than all the world, True
Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice, True
Lavinia is thine elder brothers hope, True
Why are ye mad or know ye not in Rome, True
How furious and impatient they be, True
And cannot brook competitors in love, True
I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths, True
Aaron a thousand deaths, True
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love, True
Why makest thou it so strange, True
She is a woman therefore may be wood, True
She is a woman therefore may be won, True
She is Lavinia therefore must be loved, True
What man more water glideth by the mill, True
Than wots the miller of and easy it is, True
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know, True
Though Bassianus be the emperors brother, True
Better than he have worn Vulcans badge, True
Aside Ay and as good as Saturninus may, True
Then why should he despair that knows to court it, True
With words fair looks and liberality, True
What hast not thou full often struck a doe, True
And borne her cleanly by the keepers nose, True
Why then it seems some certain snatch or so, True
Would serve your turns, True
Ay so the turn were served, True
Aaron thou hast hit it, True
Would you had hit it too, True
Then should not we be tired with this ado, True
Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools, True
To square for this would it offend you then, True
That both should speed, True
Nor me so I were one, True
For shame be friends and join for that you jar, True
Tis policy and stratagem must do, True
That you affect and so must you resolve, True
That what you cannot as you would achieve, True
You must perforce accomplish as you may, True
Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste, True
Than this Lavinia Bassianus love, True
A speedier course than lingering languishment, True
Must we pursue and I have found the path, True
My lords a solemn hunting is in hand, True
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop, True
The forest walks are wide and spacious, True
And many unfrequented plots there are, True
Fitted by kind for rape and villany, True
Single you thither then this dainty doe, True
And strike her home by force if not by words, True
This way or not at all stand you in hope, True
Come come our empress with her sacred wit, True
To villany and vengeance consecrate, True
Will we acquaint with all that we intend, True
And she shall file our engines with advice, True
That will not suffer you to square yourselves, True
But to your wishes height advance you both, True
The emperors court is like the house of Fame, True
The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears, True
The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull, True
There speak and strike brave boys and take, True
There serve your lusts shadowd from heavens eye, True
And revel in Lavinias treasury, True
Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice, True
Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream, True
To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits, True
Per Styga per manes vehor, True

And rouse the prince and ring a hunters peal, True
That all the court may echo with the noise, True
Sons let it be your charge as it is ours, True
To attend the emperors person carefully, True
I have been troubled in my sleep this night, True
But dawning day new comfort hath inspired, True
A cry of hounds and horns winded in a peal Enter SATURNINUS TAMORA BASSIANUS LAVINIA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and Attendants, True
Many good morrows to your majesty, True
Madam to you as many and as good, True
I promised your grace a hunters peal, True
And you have rung it lustily my lord, True
Somewhat too early for newmarried ladies, True
Lavinia how say you, True
I have been broad awake two hours and more, True
Come on then horse and chariots let us have, True
Madam now shall ye see, True
I have dogs my lord, True
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase, True
And climb the highest promontory top, True
And I have horse will follow where the game, True
Makes way and run like swallows oer the plain, True
Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound, True
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground, True
SCENE III A lonely part of the forest, True
Enter AARON with a bag of gold, True
He that had wit would think that I had none, True
To bury so much gold under a tree, True
And never after to inherit it, True
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly, True
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem, True
Which cunningly effected will beget, True
A very excellent piece of villany, True
And so repose sweet gold for their unrest, True
That have their alms out of the empress chest, True
My lovely Aaron wherefore lookst thou sad, True
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast, True
The birds chant melody on every bush, True
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun, True
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind, True
And make a chequerd shadow on the ground, True
Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit, True
And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds, True
Replying shrilly to the welltuned horns, True
As if a double hunt were heard at once, True
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise, True
And after conflict such as was supposed, True
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoyd, True
When with a happy storm they were surprised, True
And curtaind with a counselkeeping cave, True
We may each wreathed in the others arms, True
Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber, True
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds, True
Be unto us as is a nurses song, True
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep, True
Madam though Venus govern your desires, True
Saturn is dominator over mine, True
What signifies my deadlystanding eye, True
My silence and my cloudy melancholy, True
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls, True
Even as an adder when she doth unroll, True
To do some fatal execution, True
No madam these are no venereal signs, True
Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand, True
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head, True
Hark Tamora the empress of my soul, True
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee, True
This is the day of doom for Bassianus, True
His Philomel must lose her tongue today, True
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity, True
And wash their hands in Bassianus blood, True
Seest thou this letter take it up I pray thee, True
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll, True
Now question me no more we are espied, True
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty, True
Which dreads not yet their lives destruction, True
Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life, True
No more great empress Bassianus comes, True
Be cross with him and Ill go fetch thy sons, True
To back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be, True
Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA, True
Who have we here Romes royal empress, True
Unfurnishd of her wellbeseeming troop, True
Or is it Dian habited like her, True
Who hath abandoned her holy groves, True
To see the general hunting in this forest, True
Saucy controller of our private steps, True
Had I the power that some say Dian had, True
Thy temples should be planted presently, True
With horns as was Actaeons and the hounds, True
Should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs, True
Unmannerly intruder as thou art, True
Under your patience gentle empress, True
Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning, True
And to be doubted that your Moor and you, True
Are singled forth to try experiments, True
Jove shield your husband from his hounds today, True
Tis pity they should take him for a stag, True
Believe me queen your swarth Cimmerian, True
Doth make your honour of his bodys hue, True
Spotted detested and abominable, True
Why are you sequesterd from all your train, True
Dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed, True
And wanderd hither to an obscure plot, True
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor, True
If foul desire had not conducted you, True
And being intercepted in your sport, True
Great reason that my noble lord be rated, True
For sauciness I pray you let us hence, True
And let her joy her ravencolourd love, True
This valley fits the purpose passing well, True
The king my brother shall have note of this, True
Ay for these slips have made him noted long, True
Good king to be so mightily abused, True
Why have I patience to endure all this, True
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, True
How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother, True
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan, True
Have I not reason think you to look pale, True
These two have ticed me hither to this place, True
A barren detested vale you see it is, True
The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean, True
Oercome with moss and baleful mistletoe, True
Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds, True
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven, True
And when they showd me this abhorred pit, True
They told me here at dead time of the night, True
A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes, True
Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins, True
Would make such fearful and confused cries, True
As any mortal body hearing it, True
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly, True
No sooner had they told this hellish tale, True
But straight they told me they would bind me here, True
Unto the body of a dismal yew, True
And leave me to this miserable death, True
And then they calld me foul adulteress, True
Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms, True
That ever ear did hear to such effect, True
And had you not by wondrous fortune come, True
This vengeance on me had they executed, True
Revenge it as you love your mothers life, True
Or be ye not henceforth calld my children, True
This is a witness that I am thy son, True
And this for me struck home to show my strength, True
Also stabs BASSIANUS who dies, True
Ay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora, True
For no name fits thy nature but thy own, True
Give me thy poniard you shall know my boys, True
Your mothers hand shall right your mothers wrong, True
Stay madam here is more belongs to her, True
First thrash the corn then after burn the straw, True
This minion stood upon her chastity, True
Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty, True
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness, True
And shall she carry this unto her grave, True
An if she do I would I were an eunuch, True
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole, True
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust, True
But when ye have the honey ye desire, True
Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting, True
I warrant you madam we wil l make that sure, True
Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy, True
That nicepreserved honesty of yours, True
O Tamora thou bearst a womans face, True
I will not hear her speak away with her, True
Sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word, True
Listen fair madam let it be your glory, True
To see her tears but be your heart to them, True
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain, True
When did the tigers young ones teach the dam, True
O do not learn her wrath she taught it thee, True
The milk thou suckdst from her did turn to marble, True
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny, True
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike, True
Do thou entreat her show a woman pity, True
What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard, True
Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark, True
Yet have I heardO could I find it now, True
The lion moved with pity did endure, True
To have his princely paws pared all away, True
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children, True
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests, True
O be to me though thy hard heart say no, True
Nothing so kind but something pitiful, True
I know not what it means away with her, True
O let me teach thee for my fathers sake, True
That gave thee life when well he might have, True
Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears, True
Hadst thou in person neer offended me, True
Even for his sake am I pitiless, True
Remember boys I pourd forth tears in vain, True
To save your brother from the sacrifice, True
But fierce Andronicus would not relent, True
Therefore away with her and use her as you will, True
The worse to her the better loved of me, True
O Tamora be calld a gentle queen, True
And with thine own hands kill me in this place, True
For tis not life that I have beggd so long, True
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died, True
What beggst thou then fond woman let me go, True
Tis present death I beg and one thing more, True
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell, True
O keep me from their worse than killing lust, True
And tumble me into some loathsome pit, True
Where never mans eye may behold my body, True
Do this and be a charitable murderer, True
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee, True
No let them satisfy their lust on thee, True
Away for thou hast stayd us here too long, True
No grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature, True
The blot and enemy to our general name, True
Nay then Ill stop your mouth Bring thou her husband, True
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him, True
DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the pit then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON dragging off LAVINIA, True
Farewell my sons see that you make her sure, True
Neer let my heart know merry cheer indeed, True
Till all the Andronici be made away, True
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor, True
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflowr, True
Reenter AARON with QUINTUS and MARTIUS, True
Come on my lords the better foot before, True
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit, True
Where I espied the panther fast asleep, True
My sight is very dull whateer it bodes, True
And mine I promise you weret not for shame, True
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile, True
What art thou falln What subtle hole is this, True
Whose mouth is coverd with rudegrowing briers, True
Upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood, True
As fresh as morning dew distilld on flowers, True
A very fatal place it seems to me, True
Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall, True
O brother with the dismallst object hurt, True
That ever eye with sight made heart lament, True
Aside Now will I fetch the king to find them here, True
That he thereby may give a likely guess, True
How these were they that made away his brother, True
Why dost not comfort me and help me out, True
From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole, True
I am surprised with an uncouth fear, True
A chilling sweat oerruns my trembling joints, True
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see, True
To prove thou hast a truedivining heart, True
Aaron and thou look down into this den, True
And see a fearful sight of blood and death, True
Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart, True
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold, True
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise, True
O tell me how it is for neer till now, True
Was I a child to fear I know not what, True
Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here, True
All on a heap like to a slaughterd lamb, True
In this detested dark blooddrinking pit, True
If it be dark how dost thou know tis he, True
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear, True
A precious ring that lightens all the hole, True
Which like a taper in some monument, True
Doth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeks, True
And shows the ragged entrails of the pit, True
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus, True
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood, True
O brother help me with thy fainting hand, True
If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath, True
Out of this fell devouring receptacle, True
As hateful as Cocytus misty mouth, True
Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out, True
Or wanting strength to do thee so much good, True
I may be pluckd into the swallowing womb, True
Of this deep pit poor Bassianus grave, True
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink, True
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help, True
Thy hand once more I will not loose again, True
Till thou art here aloft or I below, True
Thou canst not come to me I come to thee, True
Enter SATURNINUS with AARON, True
Along with me Ill see what hole is here, True
And what he is that now is leapd into it, True
Say who art thou that lately didst descend, True
Into this gaping hollow of the earth, True

Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, True
Who is this my niece that flies away so fast, True
Cousin a word where is your husband, True
If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me, True
If I do wake some planet strike me down, True
That I may slumber in eternal sleep, True
Speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands, True
Have loppd and hewd and made thy body bare, True
Of her two branches those sweet ornaments, True
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in, True
And might not gain so great a happiness, True
As have thy love Why dost not speak to me, True
Alas a crimson river of warm blood, True
Like to a bubbling fountain stirrd with wind, True
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips, True
Coming and going with thy honey breath, True
But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee, True
And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue, True
Ah now thou turnst away thy face for shame, True
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood, True
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts, True
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titans face, True
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud, True
Shall I speak for thee shall I say tis so, True
O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast, True
That I might rail at him to ease my mind, True
Sorrow concealed like an oven stoppd, True
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is, True
Fair Philomela she but lost her tongue, True
And in a tedious sampler sewd her mind, True
But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee, True
A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met, True
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off, True
That could have better sewd than Philomel, True
O had the monster seen those lily hands, True
Tremble like aspenleaves upon a lute, True
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, True
He would not then have touchd them for his life, True
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony, True
Which that sweet tongue hath made, True
He would have droppd his knife and fell asleep, True
As Cerberus at the Thracian poets feet, True
Come let us go and make thy father blind, True
For such a sight will blind a fathers eye, True
One hours storm will drown the fragrant meads, True
What will whole months of tears thy fathers eyes, True
Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee, True
O could our mourning ease thy misery, True
SCENE I Rome A street, True
Enter Judges Senators and Tribunes with MARTIUS and QUINTUS bound passing on to the place of execution TITUS going before pleading, True
Hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay, True
For pity of mine age whose youth was spent, True
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept, True
For all my blood in Romes great quarrel shed, True
For all the frosty nights that I have watchd, True
And for these bitter tears which now you see, True
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks, True
Be pitiful to my condemned sons, True
Whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought, True
For two and twenty sons I never wept, True
Because they died in honours lofty bed, True
Lieth down the Judges  c pass by him and Exeunt, True
For these these tribunes in the dust I write, True
My hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears, True
Let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite, True
My sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush, True
O earth I will befriend thee more with rain, True
That shall distil from these two ancient urns, True
Than youthful April shall with all his showers, True
In summers drought Ill drop upon thee still, True
In winter with warm tears Ill melt the snow, True
And keep eternal springtime on thy face, True
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood, True
Enter LUCIUS with his sword drawn, True
O reverend tribunes O gentle aged men, True
Unbind my sons reverse the doom of death, True
And let me say that never wept before, True
My tears are now prevailing orators, True
O noble father you lament in vain, True
The tribunes hear you not no man is by, True
And you recount your sorrows to a stone, True
Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead, True
Grave tribunes once more I entreat of you, True
My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak, True
Why tis no matter man if they did hear, True
They would not mark me or if they did mark, True
They would not pity me yet plead I must, True
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones, True
Who though they cannot answer my distress, True
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes, True
For that they will not intercept my tale, True
When I do weep they humbly at my feet, True
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me, True
And were they but attired in grave weeds, True
Rome could afford no tribune like to these, True
A stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones, True
A stone is silent and offendeth not, True
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death, True
But wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn, True
To rescue my two brothers from their death, True
For which attempt the judges have pronounced, True
My everlasting doom of banishment, True
O happy man they have befriended thee, True
Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive, True
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers, True
Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey, True
But me and mine how happy art thou then, True
From these devourers to be banished, True
But who comes with our brother Marcus here, True
Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA, True
Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep, True
Or if not so thy noble heart to break, True
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age, True
Will it consume me let me see it then, True
This was thy daughter, True
Why Marcus so she is, True
Ay me this object kills me, True
Fainthearted boy arise and look upon her, True
Speak Lavinia what accursed hand, True
Hath made thee handless in thy fathers sight, True
What fool hath added water to the sea, True
Or brought a faggot to brightburning Troy, True
My grief was at the height before thou camest, True
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds, True
Give me a sword Ill chop off my hands too, True
For they have fought for Rome and all in vain, True
And they have nursed this woe in feeding life, True
In bootless prayer have they been held up, True
And they have served me to effectless use, True
Now all the service I require of them, True
Is that the one will help to cut the other, True
Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands, True
For hands to do Rome service are but vain, True
Speak gentle sister who hath martyrd thee, True
O that delightful engine of her thoughts, True
That blabbd them with such pleasing eloquence, True
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage, True
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung, True
Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear, True
O say thou for her who hath done this deed, True
O thus I found her straying in the park, True
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer, True
That hath received some unrecuring wound, True
It was my deer and he that wounded her, True
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead, True
For now I stand as one upon a rock, True
Environed with a wilderness of sea, True
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave, True
Expecting ever when some envious surge, True
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him, True
This way to death my wretched sons are gone, True
Here stands my other son a banished man, True
And here my brother weeping at my woes, True
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn, True
Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul, True
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight, True
It would have madded me what shall I do, True
Now I behold thy lively body so, True
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears, True
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyrd thee, True
Thy husband he is dead and for his death, True
Thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this, True
Look Marcus ah son Lucius look on her, True
When I did name her brothers then fresh tears, True
Stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew, True
Upon a gatherd lily almost witherd, True
Perchance she weeps because they killd her husband, True
Perchance because she knows them innocent, True
If they did kill thy husband then be joyful, True
Because the law hath taen revenge on them, True
No no they would not do so foul a deed, True
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes, True
Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips, True
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease, True
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius, True
And thou and I sit round about some fountain, True
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks, True
How they are staind as meadows yet not dry, True
With miry slime left on them by a flood, True
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long, True
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness, True
And made a brinepit with our bitter tears, True
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine, True
Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows, True
Pass the remainder of our hateful days, True
What shall we do let us that have our tongues, True
Plot some deuce of further misery, True
To make us wonderd at in time to come, True
Sweet father cease your tears for at your grief, True
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps, True
Patience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes, True
Ah Marcus Marcus brother well I wot, True
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine, True
For thou poor man hast drownd it with thine own, True
Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks, True
Mark Marcus mark I understand her signs, True
Had she a tongue to speak now would she say, True
That to her brother which I said to thee, True
His napkin with his true tears all bewet, True
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks, True
O what a sympathy of woe is this, True
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss, True
Titus Andronicus my lord the emperor, True
Sends thee this wordthat if thou love thy sons, True
Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus, True
Or any one of you chop off your hand, True
And send it to the king he for the same, True
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive, True
And that shall be the ransom for their fault, True
O gracious emperor O gentle Aaron, True
Did ever raven sing so like a lark, True
That gives sweet tidings of the suns uprise, True
With all my heart Ill send the emperor My hand, True
Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off, True
Stay father for that noble hand of thine, True
That hath thrown down so many enemies, True
Shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn, True
My youth can better spare my blood than you, True
And therefore mine shall save my brothers lives, True
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome, True
And reard aloft the bloody battleaxe, True
Writing destruction on the enemys castle, True
O none of both but are of high desert, True
My hand hath been but idle let it serve, True
To ransom my two nephews from their death, True
Then have I kept it to a worthy end, True
Nay come agree whose hand shall go along, True
For fear they die before their pardon come, True
By heaven it shall not go, True
Sirs strive no more such witherd herbs as these, True
Are meet for plucking up and therefore mine, True
Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son, True
Let me redeem my brothers both from death, True
And for our fathers sake and mothers care, True
Now let me show a brothers love to thee, True
Agree between you I will spare my hand, True
Then Ill go fetch an axe, True
But I will use the axe, True
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS, True
Come hither Aaron Ill deceive them both, True
Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine, True
Aside If that be calld deceit I will be honest, True
And never whilst I live deceive men so, True
But Ill deceive you in another sort, True
And that youll say ere half an hour pass, True
Cuts off TITUSs hand, True
Reenter LUCIUS and MARCUS, True
Now stay your strife what shall be is dispatchd, True

From thousand dangers bid him bury it, True
More hath it merited that let it have, True
As for my sons say I account of them, True
As jewels purchased at an easy price, True
And yet dear too because I bought mine own, True
I go Andronicus and for thy hand, True
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee, True
Their heads I mean O how this villany, True
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it, True
Let fools do good and fair men call for grace, True
Aaron will have his soul black like his face, True
O here I lift this one hand up to heaven, True
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth, True
If any power pities wretched tears, True
What wilt thou kneel with me, True
Do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers, True
Or with our sighs well breathe the welkin dim, True
And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds, True
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms, True
O brother speak with possibilities, True
And do not break into these deep extremes, True
Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom, True
Then be my passions bottomless with them, True
But yet let reason govern thy lament, True
If there were reason for these miseries, True
Then into limits could I bind my woes, True
When heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflow, True
If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad, True
Threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face, True
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil, True
I am the sea hark how her sighs do blow, True
She is the weeping welkin I the earth, True
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs, True
Then must my earth with her continual tears, True
Become a deluge overflowd and drownd, True
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes, True
But like a drunkard must I vomit them, True
Then give me leave for losers will have leave, True
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues, True
Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand, True
Worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid, True
For that good hand thou sentst the emperor, True
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons, True
And heres thy hand in scorn to thee sent back, True
Thy griefs their sports thy resolution mockd, True
That woe is me to think upon thy woes, True
More than remembrance of my fathers death, True
Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily, True
And be my heart an everburning hell, True
These miseries are more than may be borne, True
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal, True
But sorrow flouted at is double death, True
Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound, True
And yet detested life not shrink thereat, True
That ever death should let life bear his name, True
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe, True
Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless, True
As frozen water to a starved snake, True
When will this fearful slumber have an end, True
Now farewell flattery die Andronicus, True
Thou dost not slumber see thy two sons heads, True
Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here, True
Thy other banishd son with this dear sight, True
Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I, True
Even like a stony image cold and numb, True
Ah now no more will I control thy griefs, True
Rend off thy silver hair thy other hand, True
Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight, True
The closing up of our most wretched eyes, True
Now is a time to storm why art thou still, True
Why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour, True
Why I have not another tear to shed, True
Besides this sorrow is an enemy, True
And would usurp upon my watery eyes, True
And make them blind with tributary tears, True
Then which way shall I find Revenges cave, True
For these two heads do seem to speak to me, True
And threat me I shall never come to bliss, True
Till all these mischiefs be returnd again, True
Even in their throats that have committed them, True
Come let me see what task I have to do, True
You heavy people circle me about, True
That I may turn me to each one of you, True
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs, True
The vow is made Come brother take a head, True
And in this hand the other I will bear, True

The crying babe controlld with this discourse, True
Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam, True
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art, True

And by his side his fruit of bastardy, True
Touch not the boy he is of royal blood, True
Too like the sire for ever being good, True

Ruthful to hear yet piteously performd, True
And this shall all be buried by my death, True
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live, True

Swear that he shall and then I will begin, True
Who should I swear by thou believest no god, True
That granted how canst thou believe an oath, True
What if I do not as indeed I do not, True
Yet for I know thou art religious, True
And hast a thing within thee called conscience, True
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies, True
Which I have seen thee careful to observe, True
Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know, True
An idiot holds his bauble for a god, True
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears, True
To that Ill urge him therefore thou shalt vow, True
By that same god what god soeer it be, True
That thou adorest and hast in reverence, True
To save my boy to nourish and bring him up, True
Or else I will discover nought to thee, True
Even by my god I swear to thee I will, True

As sure a card as ever won the set, True
That bloody mind I think they learnd of me, True
As true a dog as ever fought at head, True
Well let my deeds be witness of my worth, True
I traind thy brethren to that guileful hole, True
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay, True
I wrote the letter that thy father found, True
And hid the gold within the letter mentiond, True
Confederate with the queen and her two sons, True
And what not done that thou hast cause to rue, True
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it, True
I playd the cheater for thy fathers hand, True
And when I had it drew myself apart, True
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter, True
I pryd me through the crevice of a wall, True
When for his hand he had his two sons heads, True
Beheld his tears and laughd so heartily, True
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his , True

Breathe out invectives gainst the officers, True
O Clifford but bethink thee once again, True
And in thy thought oerrun my former time, True
And if though canst for blushing view this face, True
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice, True

And ten to one is no impeach of valour, True

What would your grace have done unto him now, True
Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland, True
Come make him stand upon this molehill here, True
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms, True
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand, True
What was it you that would be Englands king, True
Wast you that revelld in our parliament, True
And made a preachment of your high descent, True
Where are your mess of sons to back you now, True
The wanton Edward and the lusty George, True
And wheres that valiant crookback prodigy, True
Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice, True
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies, True
Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland, True
Look York I staind this napkin with the blood, True
That valiant Clifford with his rapiers point, True
Made issue from the bosom of the boy, True
And if thine eyes can water for his death, True
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal, True
Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly, True
I should lament thy miserable state, True
I prithee grieve to make me merry York, True
What hath thy fiery heart so parchd thine entrails, True
That not a tear can fall for Rutlands death, True
Why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad, True
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus, True
Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance, True
Thou wouldst be feed I see to make me sport, True
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown, True

Putting a paper crown on his head, True
Ay marry sir now looks he like a king, True
Ay this is he that took King Henrys chair, True
And this is he was his adopted heir, True
But how is it that great Plantagenet, True
Is crownd so soon and broke his solemn oath, True
As I bethink me you should not be king, True
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death, True
And will you pale your head in Henrys glory, True
And rob his temples of the diadem, True
Now in his life against your holy oath, True
O tis a fault too too unpardonable, True
Off with the crown and with the crown his head, True
And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead, True
That is my office for my fathers sake, True
Nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes, True
Shewolf of France but worse than wolves of France, True
Whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth, True
How illbeseeming is it in thy sex, True
To triumph like an Amazonian trull, True
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates, True
But that thy face is vizardlike unchanging, True
Made impudent with use of evil deeds, True
I would assay proud queen to make thee blush, True
To tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived, True
Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless, True
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, True
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, True
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman, True
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult, True
It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen, True
Unless the adage must be verified, True
That beggars mounted run their horse to death, True
Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud, True
But God he knows thy share thereof is small, True
Tis virtue that doth make them most admired, True
The contrary doth make thee wonderd at, True
Tis government that makes them seem divine, True
The want thereof makes thee abominable, True
Thou art as opposite to every good, True
As the Antipodes are unto us, True
Or as the south to the septentrion, True
O tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide, True
How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child, True
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, True
And yet be seen to bear a womans face, True
Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible, True
Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless, True
Bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish, True
Wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will, True
For raging wind blows up incessant showers, True
And when the rage allays the rain begins, True
These tears are my sweet Rutlands obsequies, True
And every drop cries vengeance for his death, True
Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false, True
Beshrew me but his passion moves me so, True
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears, True
That face of his the hungry cannibals, True
Would not have touchd would not have staind with blood, True
But you are more inhuman more inexorable, True
O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania, True
See ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears, True
This cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy, True
And I with tears do wash the blood away, True
Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this, True
And if thou tellst the heavy story right, True
Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears, True
Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears, True
And say Alas it was a piteous deed, True
There take the crown and with the crown my curse, True
And in thy need such comfort come to thee, True
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand, True
Hardhearted Clifford take me from the world, True
My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads, True
Had he been slaughterman to all my kin, True
I should not for my life but weep with him, True
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul, True
What weepingripe my Lord Northumberland, True
Think but upon the wrong he did us all, True
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears, True
Heres for my oath heres for my fathers death, True
And heres to right our gentlehearted king, True
Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God, True
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee, True
Off with his head and set it on York gates, True
So York may overlook the town of York, True
SCENE I A plain near Mortimers Cross in Herefordshire, True
A march Enter EDWARD RICHARD and their power, True
I wonder how our princely father scaped, True
Or whether he be scaped away or no, True
From Cliffords and Northumberlands pursuit, True
Had he been taen we should have heard the news, True
Had he been slain we should have heard the news, True
Or had he scaped methinks we should have heard, True
The happy tidings of his good escape, True
How fares my brother why is he so sad, True
I cannot joy until I be resolved, True
Where our right valiant father is become, True
I saw him in the battle range about, True
And watchd him how he singled Clifford forth, True
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop, True
As doth a lion in a herd of neat, True
Or as a bear encompassd round with dogs, True
Who having pinchd a few and made them cry, True
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him, True
So fared our father with his enemies, True
So fled his enemies my warlike father, True
Methinks tis prize enough to be his son, True
See how the morning opes her golden gates, True
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun, True
How well resembles it the prime of youth, True
Trimmd like a younker prancing to his love, True
Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns, True
Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun, True
Not separated with the racking clouds, True
But severd in a pale clearshining sky, True
See see they join embrace and seem to kiss, True
As if they vowd some league inviolable, True
Now are they but one lamp one light one sun, True
In this the heaven figures some event, True
Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of, True
I think it cites us brother to the field, True
That we the sons of brave Plantagenet, True
Each one already blazing by our meeds, True
Should notwithstanding join our lights together, True
And overshine the earth as this the world, True
Whateer it bodes henceforward will I bear, True
Upon my target three fairshining suns, True
Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it, True
You love the breeder better than the male, True
But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell, True
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue, True
Ah one that was a woful lookeron, True
When as the noble Duke of York was slain, True
Your princely father and my loving lord, True
O speak no more for I have heard too much, True
Say how he died for I will hear it all, True
Environed he was with many foes, True
And stood against them as the hope of Troy, True
Against the Greeks that would have enterd Troy, True
But Hercules himself must yield to odds, True
And many strokes though with a little axe, True
Hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak, True
By many hands your father was subdued, True
But only slaughterd by the ireful arm, True
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen, True
Who crownd the gracious duke in high despite, True
Laughd in his face and when with grief he wept, True
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks, True
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood, True
Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain, True
And after many scorns many foul taunts, True
They took his head and on the gates of York, True
They set the same and there it doth remain, True
The saddest spectacle that eer I viewd, True
Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon, True
Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay, True
O Clifford boisterous Clifford thou hast slain, True
The flower of Europe for his chivalry, True
And treacherously hast thou vanquishd him, True
For hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee, True
Now my souls palace is become a prison, True
Ah would she break from hence that this my body, True
Might in the ground be closed up in rest, True
For never henceforth shall I joy again, True
Never O never shall I see more joy, True
I cannot weep for all my bodys moisture, True
Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart, True
Nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen, True
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal, True
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast, True
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench, True
To weep is to make less the depth of grief, True
Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me, True
Richard I bear thy name Ill venge thy death, True
Or die renowned by attempting it, True
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee, True
His dukedom and his chair with me is left, True
Nay if thou be that princely eagles bird, True
Show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun, True
For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say, True
Either that is thine or else thou wert not his, True
March Enter WARWICK MONTAGUE and their army, True
How now fair lords What fare what news abroad, True
Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount, True
Our baleful news and at each words deliverance, True
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told, True
The words would add more anguish than the wounds, True
O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain, True
O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet, True
Which held three dearly as his souls redemption, True
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death, True
Ten days ago I drownd these news in tears, True
And now to add more measure to your woes, True
I come to tell you things sith then befalln, True
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, True
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, True
Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run, True
Were brought me of your loss and his depart, True
I then in London keeper of the king, True
Musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends, True
And very well appointed as I thought, True
Marchd toward Saint Albans to intercept the queen, True
Bearing the king in my behalf along, True
For by my scouts I was advertised, True
That she was coming with a full intent, True
To dash our late decree in parliament, True
Touching King Henrys oath and your succession, True
Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met, True
Our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought, True
But whether twas the coldness of the king, True
Who lookd full gently on his warlike queen, True
That robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen, True
Or whether twas report of her success, True
Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour, True
Who thunders to his captives blood and death, True
I cannot judge but to conclude with truth, True
Their weapons like to lightning came and went, True
Our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight, True
Or like an idle thresher with a flail, True
Fell gently down as if they struck their friends, True
I cheerd them up with justice of our cause, True
With promise of high pay and great rewards, True
But all in vain they had no heart to fight, True
And we in them no hope to win the day, True
So that we fled the king unto the queen, True
Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself, True
In haste posthaste are come to join with you, True
For in the marches here we heard you were, True
Making another head to fight again, True
Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick, True
And when came George from Burgundy to England, True
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers, True
And for your brother he was lately sent, True
From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy, True
With aid of soldiers to this needful war, True
Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled, True
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit, True
But neer till now his scandal of retire, True
Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear, True
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine, True
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henrys head, True
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, True
Were he as famous and as bold in war, True
As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer, True
I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not, True
Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak, True
But in this troublous time whats to be done, True
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel, True
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns, True
Numbering our AveMaries with our beads, True
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes, True
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms, True
If for the last say ay and to it lords, True
Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out, True
And therefore comes my brother Montague, True
Attend me lords The proud insulting queen, True
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, True
And of their feather many more proud birds, True
Have wrought the easymelting king like wax, True
He swore consent to your succession, True
His oath enrolled in the parliament, True
And now to London all the crew are gone, True
To frustrate both his oath and what beside, True
May make against the house of Lancaster, True
Their power I think is thirty thousand strong, True
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself, True
With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March, True
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, True
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand, True
Why Via to London will we march amain, True
And once again bestride our foaming steeds, True
And once again cry Charge upon our foes, True
But never once again turn back and fly, True
Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak, True
Neer may he live to see a sunshine day, True
That cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay, True
Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean, True
And when thou failstas God forbid the hour, True
Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend, True
No longer Earl of March but Duke of York, True
The next degree is Englands royal throne, True
For King of England shalt thou be proclaimd, True
In every borough as we pass along, True
And he that throws not up his cap for joy, True
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head, True
King Edward valiant Richard Montague, True
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown, True
But sound the trumpets and about our task, True
Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel, True
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds, True
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine, True
Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us, True
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me, True
The queen is coming with a puissant host, True
And craves your company for speedy counsel, True
Why then it sorts brave warriors lets away, True
SCENE II Before York, True

Welcome my lord to this brave town of York, True
Yonders the head of that archenemy, True
That sought to be encompassd with your crown, True
Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord, True
Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck, True
To see this sight it irks my very soul, True
Withhold revenge dear God tis not my fault, True
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow, True
My gracious liege this too much lenity, True
And harmful pity must be laid aside, True
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks, True
Not to the beast that would usurp their den, True
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick, True
Not his that spoils her young before her face, True
Who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting, True
Not he that sets his foot upon her back, True
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on, True
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood, True
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown, True
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows, True
He but a duke would have his son a king, True
And raise his issue like a loving sire, True
Thou being a king blest with a goodly son, True
Didst yield consent to disinherit him, True
Which argued thee a most unloving father, True
Unreasonable creatures feed their young, True
And though mans face be fearful to their eyes, True
Yet in protection of their tender ones, True
Who hath not seen them even with those wings, True
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight, True
Make war with him that climbd unto their nest, True
Offer their own lives in their youngs defence, True
For shame my liege make them your precedent, True
Were it not pity that this goodly boy, True
Should lose his birthright by his fathers fault, True
And long hereafter say unto his child, True
What my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got, True
My careless father fondly gave away, True
Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy, True
And let his manly face which promiseth, True
Successful fortune steel thy melting heart, True
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him, True
Full well hath Clifford playd the orator, True
Inferring arguments of mighty force, True
But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear, True
That things illgot had ever bad success, True
And happy always was it for that son, True
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell, True
Ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind, True
And would my father had left me no more, True
For all the rest is held at such a rate, True
As brings a thousandfold more care to keep, True
Than in possession and jot of pleasure, True
Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know, True
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here, True
My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh, True
And this soft courage makes your followers faint, True
You promised knighthood to our forward son, True
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently, True
Edward Plantagenet arise a knight, True
And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right, True
My gracious father by your kingly leave, True
Ill draw it as apparent to the crown, True
And in that quarrel use it to the death, True
Why that is spoken like a toward prince, True
Royal commanders be in readiness, True
For with a band of thirty thousand men, True
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York, True
And in the towns as they do march along, True
Proclaims him king and many fly to him, True
Darraign your battle for they are at hand, True
I would your highness would depart the field, True
The queen hath best success when you are absent, True
Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune, True
Why thats my fortune too therefore Ill stay, True
Be it with resolution then to fight, True

And hearten those that fight in your defence, True
Unsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George, True
March Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD WARWICK NORFOLK MONTAGUE and Soldiers, True
Now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace, True
And set thy diadem upon my head, True
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field, True
Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy, True
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms, True
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king, True
I am his king and he should bow his knee, True
I was adopted heir by his consent, True
Since when his oath is broke for as I hear, True
You that are king though he do wear the crown, True
Have caused him by new act of parliament, True
To blot out me and put his own son in, True
Who should succeed the father but the son, True
Are you there butcher O I cannot speak, True
Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee, True
Or any he the proudest of thy sort, True
Twas you that killd young Rutland was it not, True
Ay and old York and yet not satisfied, True
For Gods sake lords give signal to the fight, True
What sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown, True
Why how now longtongued Warwick dare you speak, True
When you and I met at Saint Albans last, True
Your legs did better service than your hands, True
Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine, True
You said so much before and yet you fled, True
Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence, True
No nor your manhood that durst make you stay, True
Northumberland I hold thee reverently, True
Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain, True
The execution of my bigswoln heart, True
Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller, True
I slew thy father callst thou him a child, True
Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward, True
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland, True
But ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed, True
Have done with words my lords and hear me speak, True
Defy them then or else hold close thy lips, True
I prithee give no limits to my tongue, True
I am a king and privileged to speak, True
My liege the wound that bred this meeting here, True
Cannot be cured by words therefore be still, True
Then executioner unsheathe thy sword, True
By him that made us all I am resolved, True
that Cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue, True
Say Henry shall I have my right or no, True
A thousand men have broke their fasts today, True
That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown, True
If thou deny their blood upon thy head, True
For York in justice puts his armour on, True
If that be right which Warwick says is right, True
There is no wrong but every thing is right, True
Whoever got thee there thy mother stands, True
For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue, True
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam, True
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic, True
Markd by the destinies to be avoided, True
As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings, True
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt, True
Whose father bears the title of a king, True
As if a channel should be calld the sea, True
Shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught, True
To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart, True
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, True
To make this shameless callet know herself, True
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou, True
Although thy husband may be Menelaus, True
And neer was Agamemnons brother wrongd, True
By that false woman as this king by thee, True
His father revelld in the heart of France, True
And tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop, True
And had he matchd according to his state, True
He might have kept that glory to this day, True
But when he took a beggar to his bed, True
And graced thy poor sire with his bridalday, True
Even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him, True
That washd his fathers fortunes forth of France, True
And heapd sedition on his crown at home, True
For what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride, True
Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept, True
And we in pity of the gentle king, True
Had slippd our claim until another age, True
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring, True
And that thy summer bred us no increase, True
We set the axe to thy usurping root, True
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, True
Yet know thou since we have begun to strike, True
Well never leave till we have hewn thee down, True
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods, True
And in this resolution I defy thee, True
Not willing any longer conference, True
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak, True
Sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave, True
And either victory or else a grave, True
No wrangling woman well no longer stay, True
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day, True
SCENE III A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in, True

For this world frowns and Edwards sun is clouded, True
How now my lord what hap what hope of good, True
Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair, True
Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us, True
What counsel give you whither shall we fly, True
Bootless is flight they follow us with wings, True
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit, True
Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself, True
Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, True
Broachd with the steely point of Cliffords lance, True
And in the very pangs of death he cried, True
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far, True
Warwick revenge brother revenge my death, True
So underneath the belly of their steeds, True
That staind their fetlocks in his smoking blood, True
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost, True
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood, True
Ill kill my horse because I will not fly, True
Why stand we like softhearted women here, True

Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine, True
Or fortune given me measure of revenge, True
O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine, True
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine, True
And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face, True
I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee, True
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings, True
Beseeching thee if with they will it stands, True
That to my foes this body must be prey, True
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope, True
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul, True
Now lords take leave until we meet again, True
Whereer it be in heaven or in earth, True
Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick, True
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms, True

That winter should cut off our springtime so, True
Away away Once more sweet lords farewell, True
Yet let us all together to our troops, True
And give them leave to fly that will not stay, True
And call them pillars that will stand to us, True
And if we thrive promise them such rewards, True
As victors wear at the Olympian games, True
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts, True
For yet is hope of life and victory, True
Forslow no longer make we hence amain, True

Forced to retire by fury of the wind, True
Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind, True
Now one the better then another best, True

Yet neither conqueror nor conquered, True
So is the equal of this fell war, True
Here on this molehill will I sit me down, True

And Henry hadst thou swayd as kings should do, True
Or as thy father and his father did, True
Giving no ground unto the house of York, True
They never then had sprung like summer flies, True
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm, True
Had left no mourning widows for our death, True
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace, True
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air, True
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity, True
Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds, True
No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight, True

From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring, True
I mean our princely father Duke of York, True

Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee, True
Dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life, True
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say, True
O would he did and so perhaps he doth, True
Tis but his policy to counterfeit, True
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts, True

And now to London with triumphant march, True
There to be crowned Englands royal king, True
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, True
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen, True
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together, True
And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread, True
The scatterd foe that hopes to rise again, True

Enter KING HENRY VI disguised with a prayerbook, True
From Scotland am I stoln even of pure love, True
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight, True
No Harry Harry tis no land of thine, True
Thy place is filld thy sceptre wrung from thee, True
Thy balm washd off wherewith thou wast anointed, True
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now, True
No humble suitors press to speak for right, True
No not a man comes for redress of thee, True
For how can I help them and not myself, True
Ay heres a deer whose skins a keepers fee, True
This is the quondam king lets seize upon him, True
Let me embrace thee sour adversity, True
For wise men say it is the wisest course, True
Why linger we let us lay hands upon him, True
Forbear awhile well hear a little more, True
My queen and son are gone to France for aid, True
And as I hear the great commanding Warwick, True
Is thither gone to crave the French kings sister, True
To wife for Edward if this news be true, True
Poor queen and son your labour is but lost, True
For Warwick is a subtle orator, True
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words, True
By this account then Margaret may win him, True
For shes a woman to be pitied much, True
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast, True
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart, True
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn, True
And Nero will be tainted with remorse, True
To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears, True
Ay but shes come to beg Warwick to give, True
She on his left side craving aid for Henry, True
He on his right asking a wife for Edward, True
She weeps and says her Henry is deposed, True
He smiles and says his Edward is installd, True
That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more, True
Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong, True
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength, True
And in conclusion wins the king from her, True
With promise of his sister and what else, True
To strengthen and support King Edwards place, True
O Margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul, True
Art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn, True
Say what art thou that talkst of kings and queens, True
More than I seem and less than I was born to, True
A man at least for less I should not be, True
And men may talk of kings and why not I, True
Ay but thou talkst as if thou wert a king, True
Why so I am in mind and thats enough, True
But if thou be a king where is thy crown, True
My crown is in my heart not on my head, True
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, True
Nor to be seen my crown is called content, True
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy, True
Well if you be a king crownd with content, True
Your crown content and you must be contented, True
To go along with us for as we think, True
You are the king King Edward hath deposed, True
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance, True
Will apprehend you as his enemy, True
But did you never swear and break an oath, True
No never such an oath nor will not now, True
Where did you dwell when I was King of England, True
Here in this country where we now remain, True
I was anointed king at nine months old, True
My father and my grandfather were kings, True
And you were sworn true subjects unto me, True
And tell me then have you not broke your oaths, True
For we were subjects but while you were king, True
Why am I dead do I not breathe a man, True
Ah simple men you know not what you swear, True
Look as I blow this feather from my face, True
And as the air blows it to me again, True
Obeying with my wind when I do blow, True
And yielding to another when it blows, True
Commanded always by the greater gust, True
Such is the lightness of you common men, True
But do not break your oaths for of that sin, True
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty, True
Go where you will the king shall be commanded, True
And be you kings command and Ill obey, True
We are true subjects to the king King Edward, True
So would you be again to Henry, True
If he were seated as King Edward is, True
We charge you in Gods name and the kings, True
To go with us unto the officers, True
In Gods name lead your kings name be obeyd, True
And what God will that let your king perform, True
And what he will I humbly yield unto, True

His lands then seized on by the conqueror, True

GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire, True
Now tell me madam do you love your children, True
Ay full as dearly as I love myself, True
And would you not do much to do them good, True
To do them good I would sustain some harm, True
Then get your husbands lands to do them good, True
Therefore I came unto your majesty, True
Ill tell you how these lands are to be got, True
So shall you bind me to your highness service, True
What service wilt thou do me if I give them, True
What you command that rests in me to do, True
But you will take exceptions to my boon, True
No gracious lord except I cannot do it, True
Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask, True
Why then I will do what your grace commands, True
Aside to CLARENCE He plies her hard and much rain, True
Aside to GLOUCESTER As red as fire nay then, True
Why stops my lord shall I not hear my task, True
An easy task tis but to love a king, True
Thats soon performd because I am a subject, True
Why then thy husbands lands I freely give thee, True
I take my leave with many thousand thanks, True
Aside to CLARENCE The match is made she seals it, True
But stay thee tis the fruits of love I mean, True
The fruits of love I mean my loving liege, True
Ay but I fear me in another sense, True
What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get, True
My love till death my humble thanks my prayers, True
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants, True
No by my troth I did not mean such love, True
Why then you mean not as I thought you did, True
But now you partly may perceive my mind, True
My mind will never grant what I perceive, True
Your highness aims at if I aim aright, True
To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee, True
To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison, True
Why then thou shalt not have thy husbands lands, True
Why then mine honesty shall be my dower, True
For by that loss I will not purchase them, True
Therein thou wrongst thy children mightily, True
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me, True
But mighty lord this merry inclination, True
Accords not with the sadness of my suit, True
Please you dismiss me either with ay or no, True
Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request, True
No if thou dost say no to my demand, True
Then no my lord My suit is at an end, True
Aside to CLARENCE The widow likes him not she, True
Aside to GLOUCESTER He is the bluntest wooer in, True
Aside Her looks do argue her replete with modesty, True
Her words do show her wit incomparable, True
All her perfections challenge sovereignty, True
One way or other she is for a king, True
And she shall be my love or else my queen, True
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen, True
Tis better said than done my gracious lord, True
I am a subject fit to jest withal, True
But far unfit to be a sovereign, True
Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee, True
I speak no more than what my soul intends, True
And that is to enjoy thee for my love, True
And that is more than I will yield unto, True
I know I am too mean to be your queen, True
And yet too good to be your concubine, True
You cavil widow I did mean my queen, True
Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father, True
No more than when my daughters call thee mother, True
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children, True
And by Gods mother I being but a bachelor, True
Have other some why tis a happy thing, True
To be the father unto many sons, True
Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen, True
Aside to CLARENCE The ghostly father now hath done, True
Aside to GLOUCESTER When he was made a shriver, True
Brothers you muse what chat we two have had, True
The widow likes it not for she looks very sad, True
Youll think it strange if I should marry her, True
Why Clarence to myself, True
That would be ten days wonder at the least, True
Thats a day longer than a wonder lasts, True
By so much is the wonder in extremes, True
Well jest on brothers I can tell you both, True
Her suit is granted for her husbands lands, True
My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken, True
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate, True
See that he be conveyd unto the Tower, True
And go we brothers to the man that took him, True
To question of his apprehension, True
Widow go you along Lords use her honourably, True
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, True
Ay Edward will use women honourably, True
Would he were wasted marrow bones and all, True
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, True
To cross me from the golden time I look for, True
And yet between my souls desire and me, True
The lustful Edwards title buried, True
Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward, True
And all the unlookd for issue of their bodies, True
To take their rooms ere I can place myself, True
A cold premeditation for my purpose, True
Why then I do but dream on sovereignty, True
Like one that stands upon a promontory, True
And spies a faroff shore where he would tread, True
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye, True
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, True
Saying hell lade it dry to have his way, True
So do I wish the crown being so far off, True
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it, True
And so I say Ill cut the causes off, True
Flattering me with impossibilities, True
My eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much, True
Unless my hand and strength could equal them, True
Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard, True
What other pleasure can the world afford, True
Ill make my heaven in a ladys lap, True
And deck my body in gay ornaments, True
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks, True
O miserable thought and more unlikely, True
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns, True
Why love forswore me in my mothers womb, True
And for I should not deal in her soft laws, True
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe, True
To shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub, True
To make an envious mountain on my back, True
Where sits deformity to mock my body, True
To shape my legs of an unequal size, True
To disproportion me in every part, True
Like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp, True
That carries no impression like the dam, True
And am I then a man to be beloved, True
O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought, True
Then since this earth affords no joy to me, True
But to command to cheque to oerbear such, True
As are of better person than myself, True
Ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown, True
And whiles I live to account this world but hell, True
Until my misshaped trunk that bears this head, True
Be round impaled with a glorious crown, True
And yet I know not how to get the crown, True
For many lives stand between me and home, True
And Ilike one lost in a thorny wood, True
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, True
Seeking a way and straying from the way, True
Not knowing how to find the open air, True
But toiling desperately to find it out, True
Torment myself to catch the English crown, True
And from that torment I will free myself, True
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe, True
Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile, True
And cry Content to that which grieves my heart, True
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears, True
And frame my face to all occasions, True
Ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall, True
Ill slay more gazers than the basilisk, True
Ill play the orator as well as Nestor, True
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could, True
And like a Sinon take another Troy, True
I can add colours to the chameleon, True
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages, True
And set the murderous Machiavel to school, True
Can I do this and cannot get a crown, True
Tut were it farther off Ill pluck it down, True
SCENE III France KING LEWIS XIs palace, True
Flourish Enter KING LEWIS XI his sister BONA his Admiral called BOURBON PRINCE EDWARD QUEEN MARGARET and OXFORD KING LEWIS XI sits and riseth up again, True
Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret, True
Sit down with us it ill befits thy state, True
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit, True
No mighty King of France now Margaret, True
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve, True
Where kings command I was I must confess, True
Great Albions queen in former golden days, True
But now mischance hath trod my title down, True
And with dishonour laid me on the ground, True
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune, True
And to my humble seat conform myself, True
Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair, True
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears, True
And stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares, True
Whateer it be be thou still like thyself, True
And sit thee by our side, True
To fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind, True
Still ride in triumph over all mischance, True
Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief, True
It shall be eased if France can yield relief, True
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts, True
And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak, True
Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis, True
That Henry sole possessor of my love, True
Is of a king become a banishd man, True
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn, True
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York, True
Usurps the regal title and the seat, True
Of Englands trueanointed lawful king, True
This is the cause that I poor Margaret, True
With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir, True
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid, True
And if thou fail us all our hope is done, True
Scotland hath will to help but cannot help, True
Our people and our peers are both misled, True
Our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight, True
And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight, True
Renowned queen with patience calm the storm, True
While we bethink a means to break it off, True
The more we stay the stronger grows our foe, True
The more I stay the more Ill succor thee, True
O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow, True
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow, True
Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence, True
Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend, True
Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France, True
He descends She ariseth, True
Ay now begins a second storm to rise, True
For this is he that moves both wind and tide, True
From worthy Edward King of Albion, True
My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend, True
I come in kindness and unfeigned love, True
First to do greetings to thy royal person, True
And then to crave a league of amity, True
And lastly to confirm that amity, True
With a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant, True
That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister, True
To Englands king in lawful marriage, True
Aside If that go forward Henrys hope is done, True
To BONA And gracious madam in our kings behalf, True
I am commanded with your leave and favour, True
Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue, True
To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart, True
Where fame late entering at his heedful ears, True
Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue, True
King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak, True
Before you answer Warwick His demand, True
Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love, True
But from deceit bred by necessity, True
For how can tyrants safely govern home, True
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance, True
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice, True
That Henry liveth still but were he dead, True
Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henrys son, True
Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage, True
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour, True
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile, True
Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs, True
Because thy father Henry did usurp, True
And thou no more are prince than she is queen, True
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt, True
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain, True
And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth, True
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest, True
And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth, True
Who by his prowess conquered all France, True
From these our Henry lineally descends, True
Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse, True
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost, True
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten, True
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that, True
But for the rest you tell a pedigree, True
Of threescore and two years a silly time, True
To make prescription for a kingdoms worth, True
Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege, True
Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years, True
And not bewray thy treason with a blush, True
Can Oxford that did ever fence the right, True
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree, True
For shame leave Henry and call Edward king, True
Call him my king by whose injurious doom, True
My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere, True
Was done to death and more than so my father, True
Even in the downfall of his mellowd years, True
When nature brought him to the door of death, True
No Warwick no while life upholds this arm, True
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster, True
And I the house of York, True
Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford, True
Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside, True
While I use further conference with Warwick, True
Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not, True
Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience, True
Is Edward your true king for I were loath, True
To link with him that were not lawful chosen, True
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour, True
But is he gracious in the peoples eye, True
The more that Henry was unfortunate, True
Then further all dissembling set aside, True
Tell me for truth the measure of his love, True
Unto our sister Bona, True
As may beseem a monarch like himself, True
Myself have often heard him say and swear, True
That this his love was an eternal plant, True
Whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground, True
The leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun, True
Exempt from envy but not from disdain, True
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain, True
Now sister let us hear your firm resolve, True
Your grant or your denial shall be mine, True
Yet I confess that often ere this day, True
When I have heard your kings desert recounted, True
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire, True
Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards, True
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn, True
Touching the jointure that your king must make, True
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised, True
Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness, True
That Bona shall be wife to the English king, True
To Edward but not to the English king, True
Deceitful Warwick it was thy device, True
By this alliance to make void my suit, True
Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend, True
And still is friend to him and Margaret, True
But if your title to the crown be weak, True
As may appear by Edwards good success, True
Then tis but reason that I be released, True
From giving aid which late I promised, True
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand, True
That your estate requires and mine can yield, True
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, True
Where having nothing nothing can he lose, True
And as for you yourself our quondam queen, True
You have a father able to maintain you, True
And better twere you troubled him than France, True
Peace impudent and shameless Warwick peace, True
Proud setter up and puller down of kings, True
I will not hence till with my talk and tears, True
Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold, True
Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love, True
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather, True
Post blows a horn within, True
Warwick this is some post to us or thee, True
To WARWICK My lord ambassador these letters are for you, True
Sent from your brother Marquess Montague, True
These from our king unto your majesty, True
And madam these for you from whom I know not, True
They all read their letters, True
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress, True
Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his, True
Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled, True
I hope alls for the best, True
Warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen, True
Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys, True
Mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent, True
What has your king married the Lady Grey, True
And now to soothe your forgery and his, True
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience, True
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France, True
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner, True
I told your majesty as much before, True
This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty, True
King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven, True
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, True
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards, True
No more my king for he dishonours me, True
But most himself if he could see his shame, True
Did I forget that by the house of York, True
My father came untimely to his death, True
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece, True
Did I impale him with the regal crown, True
Did I put Henry from his native right, True
And am I guerdond at the last with shame, True
Shame on himself for my desert is honour, True
And to repair my honour lost for him, True
I here renounce him and return to Henry, True
My noble queen let former grudges pass, True
And henceforth I am thy true servitor, True
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona, True
And replant Henry in his former state, True
Warwick these words have turnd my hate to love, True
And I forgive and quite forget old faults, True
And joy that thou becomest King Henrys friend, True
So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend, True
That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us, True
With some few bands of chosen soldiers, True
Ill undertake to land them on our coast, True
And force the tyrant from his seat by war, True
Tis not his newmade bride shall succor him, True
And as for Clarence as my letters tell me, True
Hes very likely now to fall from him, True
For matching more for wanton lust than honour, True
Or than for strength and safety of our country, True
Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged, True
But by thy help to this distressed queen, True
Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live, True
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair, True
My quarrel and this English queens are one, True
And mine fair lady Bona joins with yours, True
And mine with hers and thine and Margarets, True
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved, True
Let me give humble thanks for all at once, True
Then Englands messenger return in post, True
And tell false Edward thy supposed king, True
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers, True
To revel it with him and his new bride, True
Thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal, True
Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly, True
Ill wear the willow garland for his sake, True
Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside, True
And I am ready to put armour on, True
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, True
And therefore Ill uncrown him eret be long, True
Theres thy reward be gone, True
Thou and Oxford with five thousand men, True
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle, True
And as occasion serves this noble queen, True
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply, True
Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt, True
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty, True
This shall assure my constant loyalty, True
That if our queen and this young prince agree, True
Ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy, True
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands, True
Yes I agree and thank you for your motion, True
Son Edward she is fair and virtuous, True
Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick, True
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable, True
That only Warwicks daughter shall be thine, True
Yes I accept her for she well deserves it, True
And here to pledge my vow I give my hand, True
He gives his hand to WARWICK, True
Why stay we now These soldiers shall be levied, True
And thou Lord Bourbon our high admiral, True
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet, True
I long till Edward fall by wars mischance, True
For mocking marriage with a dame of France, True
Exeunt all but WARWICK, True
I came from Edward as ambassador, True
But I return his sworn and mortal foe, True
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, True
But dreadful war shall answer his demand, True
Had he none else to make a stale but me, True
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow, True
I was the chief that raised him to the crown, True
And Ill be chief to bring him down again, True
Not that I pity Henrys misery, True
But seek revenge on Edwards mockery, True
SCENE I London The palace, True
Enter GLOUCESTER CLARENCE SOMERSET and MONTAGUE, True
Now tell me brother Clarence what think you, True
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey, True
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice, True
Alas you know tis far from hence to France, True
How could he stay till Warwick made return, True
My lords forbear this talk here comes the king, True
And his wellchosen bride, True
I mind to tell him plainly what I think, True
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD IV attended QUEEN ELIZABETH PEMBROKE STAFFORD HASTINGS and others, True
Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice, True
That you stand pensive as half malcontent, True
As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick, True
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment, True
That theyll take no offence at our abuse, True
Suppose they take offence without a cause, True
They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward, True
Your king and Warwicks and must have my will, True
And shall have your will because our king, True
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well, True
Yea brother Richard are you offended too, True
No God forbid that I should wish them severd, True
Whom God hath joind together ay and twere pity, True
To sunder them that yoke so well together, True
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, True
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey, True
Should not become my wife and Englands queen, True
And you too Somerset and Montague, True
Speak freely what you think, True
Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis, True
Becomes your enemy for mocking him, True
About the marriage of the Lady Bona, True
And Warwick doing what you gave in charge, True
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage, True
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased, True
By such invention as I can devise, True
Yet to have joind with France in such alliance, True
Would more have strengthend this our commonwealth, True
Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage, True
Why knows not Montague that of itself, True
England is safe if true within itself, True
But the safer when tis backd with France, True
Tis better using France than trusting France, True
Let us be backd with God and with the seas, True
Which He hath given for fence impregnable, True
And with their helps only defend ourselves, True
In them and in ourselves our safety lies, True
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves, True
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford, True
Ay what of that it was my will and grant, True
And for this once my will shall stand for law, True
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well, True
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales, True
Unto the brother of your loving bride, True
She better would have fitted me or Clarence, True
But in your bride you bury brotherhood, True
Or else you would not have bestowd the heir, True
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wifes son, True
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere, True
Alas poor Clarence is it for a wife, True
That thou art malcontent I will provide thee, True
In choosing for yourself you showd your judgment, True
Which being shallow you give me leave, True
To play the broker in mine own behalf, True
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you, True
Leave me or tarry Edward will be king, True
And not be tied unto his brothers will, True
My lords before it pleased his majesty, True
To raise my state to title of a queen, True
Do me but right and you must all confess, True
That I was not ignoble of descent, True
And meaner than myself have had like fortune, True
But as this title honours me and mine, True
So your dislike to whom I would be pleasing, True
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow, True
My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns, True
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee, True
So long as Edward is thy constant friend, True
And their true sovereign whom they must obey, True
Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too, True
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands, True
Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe, True
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath, True
Aside I hear yet say not much but think the more, True
Now messenger what letters or what news, True
My sovereign liege no letters and few words, True
But such as I without your special pardon, True
Go to we pardon thee therefore in brief, True
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them, True
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters, True
At my depart these were his very words, True
Go tell false Edward thy supposed king, True
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers, True
To revel it with him and his new bride, True
Is Lewis so brave belike he thinks me Henry, True
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage, True
These were her words utterd with mad disdain, True
Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly, True
Ill wear the willow garland for his sake, True
I blame not her she could say little less, True
She had the wrong But what said Henrys queen, True
For I have heard that she was there in place, True
Tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done, True
And I am ready to put armour on, True
Belike she minds to play the Amazon, True
But what said Warwick to these injuries, True
He more incensed against your majesty, True
Than all the rest discharged me with these words, True
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, True
And therefore Ill uncrown him eret be long, True
Ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words, True
Well I will arm me being thus forewarnd, True
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption, True
But say is Warwick friends with Margaret, True
Ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in, True
That young Prince Edward marries Warwicks daughter, True
Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger, True
Now brother king farewell and sit you fast, True
For I will hence to Warwicks other daughter, True
That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage, True
I may not prove inferior to yourself, True
You that love me and Warwick follow me, True
Exit CLARENCE and SOMERSET follows, True
My thoughts aim at a further matter I, True
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown, True
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick, True
Yet am I armd against the worst can happen, True
And haste is needful in this desperate case, True
Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf, True
Go levy men and make prepare for war, True
They are already or quickly will be landed, True
Myself in person will straight follow you, True
Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD, True
But ere I go Hastings and Montague, True
Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest, True
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance, True
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me, True
If it be so then both depart to him, True
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends, True
But if you mind to hold your true obedience, True
Give me assurance with some friendly vow, True
That I may never have you in suspect, True
So God help Montague as he proves true, True
And Hastings as he favours Edwards cause, True
Now brother Richard will you stand by us, True
Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you, True
Why so then am I sure of victory, True
Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour, True
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power, True

Fear not that my lord, True
Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick, True
And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice, True
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart, True
Hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love, True

But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine, True
And now what rests but in nights coverture, True
Thy brother being carelessly encampd, True
His soldiers lurking in the towns about, True
And but attended by a simple guard, True
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure, True
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy, True
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede, True
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tents, True
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, True
So we well coverd with the nights black mantle, True
At unawares may beat down Edwards guard, True
And seize himself I say not slaughter him, True
For I intend but only to surprise him, True

That with the king here resteth in his tent, True
Tis the Lord Hastings the kings chiefest friend, True
O is it so But why commands the king, True
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, True
While he himself keeps in the cold field, True
Tis the more honour because more dangerous, True
Ay but give me worship and quietness, True
I like it better than a dangerous honour, True
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, True
Tis to be doubted he would waken him, True
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage, True
Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent, True
But to defend his person from nightfoes, True

For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure, True

Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous, True
And now may seem as wise as virtuous, True
By spying and avoiding fortunes malice, True
For few men rightly temper with the stars, True
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace, True
For choosing me when Clarence is in place, True
No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway, True
To whom the heavens in thy nativity, True

To Henrys body and supply his place, True
I mean in bearing weight of government, True
While he enjoys the honour and his ease, True

But with the first of all your chief affairs, True
Let me entreat for I command no more, True

He was conveyd by Richard Duke of Gloucester, True
And the Lord Hastings who attended him, True
In secret ambush on the forest side, True
And from the bishops huntsmen rescued him, True
For hunting was his daily exercise, True
My brother was too careless of his charge, True
But let us hence my sovereign to provide, True
A salve for any sore that may betide, True
Exeunt all but SOMERSET HENRY OF RICHMOND and OXFORD, True

And we shall have more wars before t be long, True
As Henrys late presaging prophecy, True
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond, True
So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts, True

I prophesied France will be lost ere long, True
So there goes our protector in a rage, True
Tis known to you he is mine enemy, True
Nay more an enemy unto you all, True
And no great friend I fear me to the king, True
Consider lords he is the next of blood, True
And heir apparent to the English crown, True
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage, True
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west, True
Theres reason he should be displeased at it, True
Look to it lords let not his smoothing words, True
Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect, True
What though the common people favour him, True
Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of, True
Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice, True
Jesu maintain your royal excellence, True
With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey, True
I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss, True
He will be found a dangerous protector, True
Why should he then protect our sovereign, True
He being of age to govern of himself, True
Cousin of Somerset join you with me, True
And all together with the Duke of Suffolk, True
Well quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat, True
This weighty business will not brook delay, True
Ill to the Duke of Suffolk presently, True
Cousin of Buckingham though Humphreys pride, True
And greatness of his place be grief to us, True
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal, True
His insolence is more intolerable, True
Than all the princes in the land beside, True
If Gloucester be displaced hell be protector, True
Or thou or I Somerset will be protector, True
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal, True
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET, True
Pride went before ambition follows him, True
While these do labour for their own preferment, True
Behoves it us to labour for the realm, True
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, True
Did bear him like a noble gentleman, True
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal, True
More like a soldier than a man o the church, True
As stout and proud as he were lord of all, True
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself, True
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal, True
Warwick my son the comfort of my age, True
Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping, True
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons, True
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey, True
And brother York thy acts in Ireland, True
In bringing them to civil discipline, True
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France, True
When thou wert regent for our sovereign, True
Have made thee feard and honourd of the people, True
Join we together for the public good, True
In what we can to bridle and suppress, True
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal, True
With Somersets and Buckinghams ambition, True
And as we may cherish Duke Humphreys deeds, True
While they do tend the profit of the land, True
So God help Warwick as he loves the land, True
And common profit of his country, True
Aside And so says York for he hath greatest cause, True
Then lets make haste away and look unto the main, True
Unto the main O father Maine is lost, True
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win, True
And would have kept so long as breath did last, True
Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine, True
Which I will win from France or else be slain, True
Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY, True
Anjou and Maine are given to the French, True
Paris is lost the state of Normandy, True
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone, True
Suffolk concluded on the articles, True
The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased, True
To change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter, True
I cannot blame them all what ist to them, True
Tis thine they give away and not their own, True
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, True
And purchase friends and give to courtezans, True
Still revelling like lords till all be gone, True
While as the silly owner of the goods, True
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands, True
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof, True
While all is shared and all is borne away, True
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own, True
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue, True
While his own lands are bargaind for and sold, True
Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland, True
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood, True
As did the fatal brand Althaea burnd, True
Unto the princes heart of Calydon, True
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French, True
Cold news for me for I had hope of France, True
Even as I have of fertile Englands soil, True
A day will come when York shall claim his own, True
And therefore I will take the Nevils parts, True
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey, True
And when I spy advantage claim the crown, True
For thats the golden mark I seek to hit, True
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right, True
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, True
Nor wear the diadem upon his head, True
Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown, True
Then York be still awhile till time do serve, True
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep, True
To pry into the secrets of the state, True
Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love, True
With his new bride and Englands dearbought queen, True
And Humphrey with the peers be falln at jars, True
Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose, True
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed, True
And in my standard bear the arms of York, True
To grapple with the house of Lancaster, True
And force perforce Ill make him yield the crown, True
Whose bookish rule hath pulld fair England down, True

But as I think it was by the cardinal, True
And on the pieces of the broken wand, True
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset, True
And William de la Pole first duke of Suffolk, True
This was my dream what it doth bode God knows, True
Tut this was nothing but an argument, True
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucesters grove, True
Shall lose his head for his presumption, True
But list to me my Humphrey my sweet duke, True

And in thy closet pent up rue my shame, True
And ban thine enemies both mine and thine, True
Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief, True
Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself, True
For whilst I think I am thy married wife, True
And thou a prince protector of this land, True
Methinks I should not thus be led along, True
Maild up in shame with papers on my back, True
And followed with a rabble that rejoice, True
To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans, True
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet, True
And when I start the envious people laugh, True
And bid me be advised how I tread, True
Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke, True
Trowst thou that eer Ill look upon the world, True
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun, True
No dark shall be my light and night my day, True
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell, True
Sometime Ill say I am Duke Humphreys wife, True
And he a prince and ruler of the land, True
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was, True

Nor never seek prevention of thy foes, True

Death at whose name I oft have been afeard, True
Because I wishd this worlds eternity, True
Stanley I prithee go and take me hence, True
I care not whither for I beg no favour, True
Only convey me where thou art commanded, True
Why madam that is to the Isle of Man, True
There to be used according to your state, True
Thats bad enough for I am but reproach, True
And shall I then be used reproachfully, True
Like to a duchess and Duke Humphreys lady, True
According to that state you shall be used, True
Sheriff farewell and better than I fare, True
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame, True
It is my office and madam pardon me, True
Ay ay farewell thy office is discharged, True

Go lead the way I long to see my prison, True
SCENE I The Abbey at Bury St Edmunds, True
Sound a sennet Enter KING HENRY VI QUEEN MARGARET CARDINAL SUFFOLK YORK BUCKINGHAM SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament, True
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come, True
Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man, True
Whateer occasion keeps him from us now, True
Can you not see or will ye not observe, True
The strangeness of his alterd countenance, True
With what a majesty he bears himself, True
How insolent of late he is become, True
How proud how peremptory and unlike himself, True
We know the time since he was mild and affable, True
And if we did but glance a faroff look, True
Immediately he was upon his knee, True
That all the court admired him for submission, True
But meet him now and be it in the morn, True
When every one will give the time of day, True
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye, True
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee, True
Disdaining duty that to us belongs, True
Small curs are not regarded when they grin, True
But great men tremble when the lion roars, True
And Humphrey is no little man in England, True
First note that he is near you in descent, True
And should you fall he as the next will mount, True
Me seemeth then it is no policy, True
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears, True
And his advantage following your decease, True
That he should come about your royal person, True
Or be admitted to your highness council, True
By flattery hath he won the commons hearts, True
And when he please to make commotion, True
Tis to be feard they all will follow him, True
Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted, True
Suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden, True
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry, True
The reverent care I bear unto my lord, True
Made me collect these dangers in the duke, True
If it be fond call it a womans fear, True
Which fear if better reasons can supplant, True
I will subscribe and say I wrongd the duke, True
My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York, True
Reprove my allegation if you can, True
Or else conclude my words effectual, True
Well hath your highness seen into this duke, True
And had I first been put to speak my mind, True
I think I should have told your graces tale, True
The duchess by his subornation, True
Upon my life began her devilish practises, True
Or if he were not privy to those faults, True
Yet by reputing of his high descent, True
As next the king he was successive heir, True
And such high vaunts of his nobility, True
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess, True
By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall, True
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep, True
And in his simple show he harbours treason, True
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb, True
No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man, True
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit, True
Did he not contrary to form of law, True
Devise strange deaths for small offences done, True
And did he not in his protectorship, True
Levy great sums of money through the realm, True
For soldiers pay in France and never sent it, True
By means whereof the towns each day revolted, True
Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown, True
Which time will bring to light in smooth, True
My lords at once the care you have of us, True
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot, True
Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience, True
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent, True
From meaning treason to our royal person, True
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove, True
The duke is virtuous mild and too well given, True
To dream on evil or to work my downfall, True
Ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance, True
Seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed, True
For hes disposed as the hateful raven, True
Is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him, True
For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolf, True
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit, True
Take heed my lord the welfare of us all, True
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man, True
All health unto my gracious sovereign, True
Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France, True
That all your interest in those territories, True
Is utterly bereft you all is lost, True
Cold news Lord Somerset but Gods will be done, True
Aside Cold news for me for I had hope of France, True
As firmly as I hope for fertile England, True
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud, True
And caterpillars eat my leaves away, True
But I will remedy this gear ere long, True
Or sell my title for a glorious grave, True
All happiness unto my lord the king, True
Pardon my liege that I have stayd so long, True
Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon, True
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art, True
I do arrest thee of high treason here, True
Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush, True
Nor change my countenance for this arrest, True
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted, True
The purest spring is not so free from mud, True
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign, True
Who can accuse me wherein am I guilty, True
Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France, True
And being protector stayed the soldiers pay, True
By means whereof his highness hath lost France, True
Is it but thought so what are they that think it, True
I never robbd the soldiers of their pay, True
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France, True
So help me God as I have watchd the night, True
Ay night by night in studying good for England, True
That doit that eer I wrested from the king, True
Or any groat I hoarded to my use, True
Be brought against me at my trialday, True
No many a pound of mine own proper store, True
Because I would not tax the needy commons, True
Have I disbursed to the garrisons, True
And never askd for restitution, True
It serves you well my lord to say so much, True
I say no more than truth so help me God, True
In your protectorship you did devise, True
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of, True
That England was defamed by tyranny, True
Why tis well known that whiles I was, True
Pity was all the fault that was in me, True
For I should melt at an offenders tears, True
And lowly words were ransom for their fault, True
Unless it were a bloody murderer, True
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers, True
I never gave them condign punishment, True
Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured, True
Above the felon or what trespass else, True
My lord these faults are easy quickly answered, True
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge, True
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself, True
I do arrest you in his highness name, True
And here commit you to my lord cardinal, True
To keep until your further time of trial, True
My lord of Gloucester tis my special hope, True
That you will clear yourself from all suspect, True
My conscience tells me you are innocent, True
Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous, True
Virtue is choked with foul ambition, True
And charity chased hence by rancours hand, True
Foul subornation is predominant, True
And equity exiled your highness land, True
I know their complot is to have my life, True
And if my death might make this island happy, True
And prove the period of their tyranny, True
I would expend it with all willingness, True
But mine is made the prologue to their play, True
For thousands more that yet suspect no peril, True
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy, True
Beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice, True
And Suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate, True
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue, True
The envious load that lies upon his heart, True
And dogged York that reaches at the moon, True
Whose overweening arm I have pluckd back, True
By false accuse doth level at my life, True
And you my sovereign lady with the rest, True
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head, True
And with your best endeavour have stirrd up, True
My liefest liege to be mine enemy, True
Ay all you have laid your heads together, True
Myself had notice of your conventicles, True
And all to make away my guiltless life, True
I shall not want false witness to condemn me, True
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt, True
The ancient proverb will be well effected, True
A staff is quickly found to beat a dog, True
My liege his railing is intolerable, True
If those that care to keep your royal person, True
From treasons secret knife and traitors rage, True
Be thus upbraided chid and rated at, True
And the offender granted scope of speech, True
Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace, True
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here, True
With ignominious words though clerkly couchd, True
As if she had suborned some to swear, True
False allegations to oerthrow his state, True
But I can give the loser leave to chide, True
Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed, True
Beshrew the winners for they playd me false, True
And well such losers may have leave to speak, True
Hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day, True
Lord cardinal he is your prisoner, True
Sirs take away the duke and guard him sure, True
Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch, True
Before his legs be firm to bear his body, True
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, True
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first, True
Ah that my fear were false ah that it were, True
For good King Henry thy decay I fear, True
My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best, True
Do or undo as if ourself were here, True
What will your highness leave the parliament, True
Ay Margaret my heart is drownd with grief, True
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes, True
My body round engirt with misery, True
For whats more miserable than discontent, True
Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see, True
The map of honour truth and loyalty, True
And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come, True
That eer I proved thee false or feard thy faith, True
What louring star now envies thy estate, True
That these great lords and Margaret our queen, True
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life, True
Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong, True
And as the butcher takes away the calf, True
And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays, True
Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse, True
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence, True
And as the dam runs lowing up and down, True
Looking the way her harmless young one went, True
And can do nought but wail her darlings loss, True
Even so myself bewails good Gloucesters case, True
With sad unhelpful tears and with dimmd eyes, True
Look after him and cannot do him good, True
So mighty are his vowed enemies, True
His fortunes I will weep and twixt each groan, True
Say Whos a traitor Gloucester he is none, True
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET CARDINAL SUFFOLK and YORK SOMERSET remains apart, True
Free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams, True
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs, True
Too full of foolish pity and Gloucesters show, True
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile, True
With sorrow snares relenting passengers, True
Or as the snake rolld in a flowering bank, True
With shining chequerd slough doth sting a child, True
That for the beauty thinks it excellent, True
Believe me lords were none more wise than I, True
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good, True
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world, True
To rid us of the fear we have of him, True
That he should die is worthy policy, True
But yet we want a colour for his death, True
Tis meet he be condemnd by course of law, True
But in my mind that were no policy, True
The king will labour still to save his life, True
The commons haply rise to save his life, True
And yet we have but trivial argument, True
More than mistrust that shows him worthy death, True
So that by this you would not have him die, True
Ah York no man alive so fain as I, True
Tis York that hath more reason for his death, True
But my lord cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk, True
Say as you think and speak it from your souls, True
Weret not all one an empty eagle were set, True
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite, True
As place Duke Humphrey for the kings protector, True
So the poor chicken should be sure of death, True
Madam tis true and weret not madness then, True
To make the fox surveyor of the fold, True
Who being accused a crafty murderer, True
His guilt should be but idly posted over, True
Because his purpose is not executed, True
No let him die in that he is a fox, True
By nature proved an enemy to the flock, True
Before his chaps be staind with crimson blood, True
As Humphrey proved by reasons to my liege, True
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him, True
Be it by gins by snares by subtlety, True
Sleeping or waking tis no matter how, True
So he be dead for that is good deceit, True
Which mates him first that first intends deceit, True
Thricenoble Suffolk tis resolutely spoke, True
Not resolute except so much were done, True
For things are often spoke and seldom meant, True
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue, True
Seeing the deed is meritorious, True
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe, True
Say but the word and I will be his priest, True
But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk, True
Ere you can take due orders for a priest, True
Say you consent and censure well the deed, True
And Ill provide his executioner, True
I tender so the safety of my liege, True
Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing, True
And I and now we three have spoke it, True
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom, True
Great lords from Ireland am I come amain, True
To signify that rebels there are up, True
And put the Englishmen unto the sword, True
Send succors lords and stop the rage betime, True
Before the wound do grow uncurable, True
For being green there is great hope of help, True
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop, True
What counsel give you in this weighty cause, True
That Somerset be sent as regent thither, True
Tis meet that lucky ruler be employd, True
Witness the fortune he hath had in France, True
If York with all his farfet policy, True
Had been the regent there instead of me, True
He never would have stayd in France so long, True
No not to lose it all as thou hast done, True
I rather would have lost my life betimes, True
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home, True
By staying there so long till all were lost, True
Show me one scar characterd on thy skin, True
Mens flesh preserved so whole do seldom win, True
Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire, True
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with, True
No more good York sweet Somerset be still, True
Thy fortune York hadst thou been regent there, True
Might happily have proved far worse than his, True
What worse than nought nay then a shame take all, True
And in the number thee that wishest shame, True
My Lord of York try what your fortune is, True
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms, True
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen, True
To Ireland will you lead a band of men, True
Collected choicely from each county some, True
And try your hap against the Irishmen, True
I will my lord so please his majesty, True
Why our authority is his consent, True
And what we do establish he confirms, True
Then noble York take thou this task in hand, True
I am content provide me soldiers lords, True
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs, True
A charge Lord York that I will see performd, True
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey, True
No more of him for I will deal with him, True
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more, True
And so break off the day is almost spent, True
Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event, True
My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days, True
At Bristol I expect my soldiers, True
For there Ill ship them all for Ireland, True
Ill see it truly done my Lord of York, True
Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts, True
And change misdoubt to resolution, True
Be that thou hopest to be or what thou art, True
Resign to death it is not worth the enjoying, True
Let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man, True
And find no harbour in a royal heart, True
Faster than springtime showers comes thought, True
And not a thought but thinks on dignity, True
My brain more busy than the labouring spider, True
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies, True
Well nobles well tis politicly done, True
To send me packing with an host of men, True
I fear me you but warm the starved snake, True
Who cherishd in your breasts will sting, True
Twas men I lackd and you will give them me, True
I take it kindly and yet be well assured, True
You put sharp weapons in a madmans hands, True
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band, True
I will stir up in England some black storm, True
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell, True
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage, True
Until the golden circuit on my head, True
Like to the glorious suns transparent beams, True
Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw, True
And for a minister of my intent, True
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman, True
John Cade of Ashford, True
To make commotion as full well he can, True
Under the title of John Mortimer, True
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade, True
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns, True
And fought so long till that his thighs with darts, True
Were almost like a sharpquilld porpentine, True
And in the end being rescued I have seen, True
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco, True
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells, True
Full often like a shaghaird crafty kern, True
Hath he conversed with the enemy, True
And undiscoverd come to me again, True
And given me notice of their villanies, True
This devil here shall be my substitute, True
For that John Mortimer which now is dead, True
In face in gait in speech he doth resemble, True
By this I shall perceive the commons mind, True
How they affect the house and claim of York, True
Say he be taken rackd and tortured, True
I know no pain they can inflict upon him, True
Will make him say I moved him to those arms, True
Say that he thrive as tis great like he will, True
Why then from Ireland come I with my strength, True
And reap the harvest which that rascal sowd, True
For Humphrey being dead as he shall be, True
And Henry put apart the next for me, True
SCENE II Bury St Edmunds A room of state, True

That faultless may condemn a nobleman, True
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion, True
I thank thee Meg these words content me much, True
How now why lookst thou pale why tremblest thou, True
Where is our uncle whats the matter Suffolk, True
Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead, True
Gods secret judgment I did dream tonight, True
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word, True
How fares my lord Help lords the king is dead, True
Rear up his body wring him by the nose, True
Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes, True
He doth revive again madam be patient, True
How fares my gracious lord, True
Comfort my sovereign gracious Henry comfort, True
What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me, True
Came he right now to sing a ravens note, True
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers, True
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren, True
By crying comfort from a hollow breast, True
Can chase away the firstconceived sound, True
Hide not thy poison with such sugard words, True
Lay not thy hands on me forbear I say, True
Their touch affrights me as a serpents sting, True
Thou baleful messenger out of my sight, True
Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny, True
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world, True
Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding, True
Yet do not go away come basilisk, True
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight, True
For in the shade of death I shall find joy, True
In life but double death now Gloucesters dead, True
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus, True
Although the duke was enemy to him, True
Yet he most Christianlike laments his death, True
And for myself foe as he was to me, True
Might liquid tears or heartoffending groans, True
Or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life, True
I would be blind with weeping sick with groans, True
Look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs, True
And all to have the noble duke alive, True
What know I how the world may deem of me, True
For it is known we were but hollow friends, True
It may be judged I made the duke away, True
So shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded, True
And princes courts be filld with my reproach, True
This get I by his death ay me unhappy, True
To be a queen and crownd with infamy, True
Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man, True
Be woe for me more wretched than he is, True
What dost thou turn away and hide thy face, True
I am no loathsome leper look on me, True
What art thou like the adder waxen deaf, True
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen, True
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucesters tomb, True
Why then dame Margaret was neer thy joy, True
Erect his statue and worship it, True
And make my image but an alehouse sign, True
Was I for this nigh wreckd upon the sea, True
And twice by awkward wind from Englands bank, True
Drove back again unto my native clime, True
What boded this but well forewarning wind, True
Did seem to say Seek not a scorpions nest, True
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore, True
What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts, True
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves, True
And bid them blow towards Englands blessed shore, True
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock, True
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer, True
But left that hateful office unto thee, True
The prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me, True
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore, True
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness, True
The splitting rocks cowerd in the sinking sands, True
And would not dash me with their ragged sides, True
Because thy flinty heart more hard than they, True
Might in thy palace perish Margaret, True
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs, True
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back, True
I stood upon the hatches in the storm, True
And when the dusky sky began to rob, True
My earnestgaping sight of thy lands view, True
I took a costly jewel from my neck, True
A heart it was bound in with diamonds, True
And threw it towards thy land the sea received it, True
And so I wishd thy body might my heart, True
And even with this I lost fair Englands view, True
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart, True
And calld them blind and dusky spectacles, True
For losing ken of Albions wished coast, True
How often have I tempted Suffolks tongue, True
The agent of thy foul inconstancy, True
To sit and witch me as Ascanius did, True
When he to madding Dido would unfold, True
His fathers acts commenced in burning Troy, True
Am I not witchd like her or thou not false like him, True
Ay me I can no more die Margaret, True
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long, True
Noise within Enter WARWICK SALISBURY and many Commons, True
It is reported mighty sovereign, True
That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murderd, True
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauforts means, True
The commons like an angry hive of bees, True
That want their leader scatter up and down, True
And care not who they sting in his revenge, True
Myself have calmd their spleenful mutiny, True
Until they hear the order of his death, True
That he is dead good Warwick tis too true, True
But how he died God knows not Henry, True
Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse, True
And comment then upon his sudden death, True
That shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury, True
With the rude multitude till I return, True
O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts, True
My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul, True
Some violent hands were laid on Humphreys life, True
If my suspect be false forgive me God, True
For judgment only doth belong to thee, True
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips, True
With twenty thousand kisses and to drain, True
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears, True
To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk, True
And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling, True
But all in vain are these mean obsequies, True
And to survey his dead and earthly image, True
What were it but to make my sorrow greater, True
Reenter WARWICK and others bearing GLOUCESTERS body on a bed, True
Come hither gracious sovereign view this body, True
That is to see how deep my grave is made, True
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace, True
For seeing him I see my life in death, True
As surely as my soul intends to live, True
With that dread King that took our state upon him, True
To free us from his fathers wrathful curse, True
I do believe that violent hands were laid, True
Upon the life of this thricefamed duke, True
A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue, True
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow, True
See how the blood is settled in his face, True
Oft have I seen a timelyparted ghost, True
Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless, True
Being all descended to the labouring heart, True
Who in the conflict that it holds with death, True
Attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy, True
Which with the heart there cools and neer returneth, True
To blush and beautify the cheek again, True
But see his face is black and full of blood, True
His eyeballs further out than when he lived, True
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man, True
His hair upreard his nostrils stretched with struggling, True
His hands abroad displayd as one that graspd, True
And tuggd for life and was by strength subdued, True
Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking, True
His wellproportiond beard made rough and rugged, True
Like to the summers corn by tempest lodged, True
It cannot be but he was murderd here, True
The least of all these signs were probable, True
Why Warwick who should do the duke to death, True
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection, True
And we I hope sir are no murderers, True
But both of you were vowd Duke Humphreys foes, True
And you forsooth had the good duke to keep, True
Tis like you would not feast him like a friend, True
And tis well seen he found an enemy, True
Then you belike suspect these noblemen, True
As guilty of Duke Humphreys timeless death, True
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh, True
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe, True
But will suspect twas he that made the slaughter, True
Who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest, True
But may imagine how the bird was dead, True
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak, True
Even so suspicious is this tragedy, True
Are you the butcher Suffolk Wheres your knife, True
Is Beaufort termd a kite Where are his talons, True
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men, True
But heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease, True
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart, True
That slanders me with murders crimson badge, True
Say if thou darest proud Lord of Warwickshire, True
That I am faulty in Duke Humphreys death, True
Exeunt CARDINAL SOMERSET and others, True
What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him, True
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit, True
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller, True
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times, True
Madam be still with reverence may I say, True
For every word you speak in his behalf, True
Is slander to your royal dignity, True
Bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor, True
If ever lady wrongd her lord so much, True
Thy mother took into her blameful bed, True
Some stern untutord churl and noble stock, True
Was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art, True
And never of the Nevils noble race, True
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee, True
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee, True
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames, True
And that my sovereigns presence makes me mild, True
I would false murderous coward on thy knee, True
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech, True
And say it was thy mother that thou meantst, True
That thou thyself was born in bastardy, True
And after all this fearful homage done, True
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell, True
Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men, True
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood, True
If from this presence thou darest go with me, True
Away even now or I will drag thee hence, True
Unworthy though thou art Ill cope with thee, True
And do some service to Duke Humphreys ghost, True
Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK, True
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted, True
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just, True
And he but naked though lockd up in steel, True
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted, True
Reenter SUFFOLK and WARWICK with their weapons drawn, True
Why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn, True
Here in our presence dare you be so bold, True
Why what tumultuous clamour have we here, True
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury, True
Set all upon me mighty sovereign, True
To the Commons entering Sirs stand apart, True
the king shall know your mind, True
Dread lord the commons send you word by me, True
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death, True
Or banished fair Englands territories, True
They will by violence tear him from your palace, True
And torture him with grievous lingering death, True
They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died, True
They say in him they fear your highness death, True
And mere instinct of love and loyalty, True
Free from a stubborn opposite intent, True
As being thought to contradict your liking, True
Makes them thus forward in his banishment, True
They say in care of your most royal person, True
That if your highness should intend to sleep, True
And charge that no man should disturb your rest, True
In pain of your dislike or pain of death, True
Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict, True
Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue, True
That slily glided towards your majesty, True
It were but necessary you were waked, True
Lest being sufferd in that harmful slumber, True
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal, True
And therefore do they cry though you forbid, True
That they will guard you whether you will or no, True
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is, True
With whose envenomed and fatal sting, True
Your loving uncle twenty times his worth, True
They say is shamefully bereft of life, True
Within An answer from the king my, True
Tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds, True
Could send such message to their sovereign, True
But you my lord were glad to be employd, True
To show how quaint an orator you are, True
But all the honour Salisbury hath won, True
Is that he was the lord ambassador, True
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king, True
Within An answer from the king or we will all break in, True
Go Salisbury and tell them all from me, True
I thank them for their tender loving care, True
And had I not been cited so by them, True
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat, True
For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy, True
Mischance unto my state by Suffolks means, True
And therefore by His majesty I swear, True
Whose far unworthy deputy I am, True
He shall not breathe infection in this air, True
But three days longer on the pain of death, True
O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk, True
Ungentle queen to call him gentle Suffolk, True
No more I say if thou dost plead for him, True
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath, True
Had I but said I would have kept my word, True
But when I swear it is irrevocable, True
If after three days space thou here best found, True
On any ground that I am ruler of, True
The world shall not be ransom for thy life, True
Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me, True
I have great matters to impart to thee, True
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK, True
Mischance and sorrow go along with you, True
Hearts discontent and sour affliction, True
Be playfellows to keep you company, True
Theres two of you the devil make a third, True
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps, True
Cease gentle queen these execrations, True
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave, True
Fie coward woman and softhearted wretch, True
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy, True
A plague upon them wherefore should I curse them, True
Would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan, True
I would invent as bittersearching terms, True
As curst as harsh and horrible to hear, True
Deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth, True
With full as many signs of deadly hate, True
As leanfaced Envy in her loathsome cave, True
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words, True
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint, True
Mine hair be fixed on end as one distract, True
Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban, True
And even now my burthend heart would break, True
Should I not curse them Poison be their drink, True
Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste, True
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees, True
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks, True
Their softest touch as smart as lizards sting, True
Their music frightful as the serpents hiss, True
And boding screechowls make the concert full, True
All the foul terrors in darkseated hell, True
Enough sweet Suffolk thou tormentst thyself, True
And these dread curses like the sun gainst glass, True
Or like an overcharged gun recoil, True
And turn the force of them upon thyself, True
You bade me ban and will you bid me leave, True
Now by the ground that I am banishd from, True
Well could I curse away a winters night, True
Though standing naked on a mountain top, True
Where biting cold would never let grass grow, True
And think it but a minute spent in sport, True
O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand, True
That I may dew it with my mournful tears, True
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place, True
To wash away my woful monuments, True
O could this kiss be printed in thy hand, True
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal, True
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee, True
So get thee gone that I may know my grief, True
Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by, True
As one that surfeits thinking on a want, True
I will repeal thee or be well assured, True
Adventure to be banished myself, True
And banished I am if but from thee, True
Go speak not to me even now be gone, True
O go not yet Even thus two friends condemnd, True
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves, True
Loather a hundred times to part than die, True
Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee, True
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished, True
Once by the king and three times thrice by thee, True
Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence, True
A wilderness is populous enough, True
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company, True
For where thou art there is the world itself, True
With every several pleasure in the world, True
And where thou art not desolation, True
I can no more live thou to joy thy life, True
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest, True
Wither goes Vaux so fast what news I prithee, True
To signify unto his majesty, True
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death, True
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him, True
That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air, True
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth, True
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphreys ghost, True

Buckingham I prithee pardon me, True
That I have given no answer all this while, True
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy, True
The cause why I have brought this army hither, True

Between two girls which hath the merriest eye, True
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement, True
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law, True
Good faith I am no wiser than a daw, True
Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance, True
The truth appears so naked on my side, True
That any purblind eye may find it out, True
And on my side it is so well apparelld, True
So clear so shining and so evident, True
That it will glimmer through a blind mans eye, True
Since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak, True

Now Somerset where is your argument, True
Here in my scabbard meditating that, True
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red, True
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses, True
For pale they look with fear as witnessing, True
The truth on our side, True
Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks, True
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses, True
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error, True
Hath not thy rose a canker Somerset, True
Hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet, True
Ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth, True
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood, True
Well Ill find friends to wear my bleeding roses, True
That shall maintain what I have said is true, True
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen, True
Now by this maiden blossom in my hand, True

Or durst not for his craven heart say thus, True
By him that made me Ill maintain my words, True
On any plot of ground in Christendom, True
Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge, True
For treason executed in our late kings days, True
And by his treason standst not thou attainted, True
Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry, True
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood, True
And till thou be restored thou art a yeoman, True
My father was attached not attainted, True
Condemnd to die for treason but no traitor, True
And that Ill prove on better men than Somerset, True
Were growing time once ripend to my will, True
For your partaker Pole and you yourself, True

Look to it well and say you are well warnd, True
Ah thou shalt find us ready for thee still, True
And know us by these colours for thy foes, True
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear, True
And by my soul this pale and angry rose, True
As cognizance of my blooddrinking hate, True
Will I for ever and my faction wear, True
Until it wither with me to my grave, True

Go forward and be choked with thy ambition, True
And so farewell until I meet thee next, True

Shall be wiped out in the next parliament, True

And here I prophesy this brawl today, True
Grown to this faction in the Templegarden, True
Shall send between the red rose and the white, True
A thousand souls to death and deadly night, True
Good Master Vernon I am bound to you, True

So fare my limbs with long imprisonment, True
And these grey locks the pursuivants of death, True
Nestorlike aged in an age of care, True
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer, True
These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent, True
Wax dim as drawing to their exigent, True
Weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief, True
And pithless arms like to a witherd vine, True
That droops his sapless branches to the ground, True
Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb, True
Unable to support this lump of clay, True
Swiftwinged with desire to get a grave, True
As witting I no other comfort have, True
But tell me keeper will my nephew come, True
Richard Plantagenet my lord will come, True
We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber, True
And answer was returnd that he will come, True
Enough my soul shall then be satisfied, True
Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine, True
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign, True
Before whose glory I was great in arms, True
This loathsome sequestration have I had, True
And even since then hath Richard been obscured, True
Deprived of honour and inheritance, True
But now the arbitrator of despairs, True
Just death kind umpire of mens miseries, True
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence, True
I would his troubles likewise were expired, True
That so he might recover what was lost, True
Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET, True
My lord your loving nephew now is come, True

That I may kindly give one fainting kiss, True
And now declare sweet stem from Yorks great stock, True
Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised, True
First lean thine aged back against mine arm, True
And in that ease Ill tell thee my disease, True
This day in argument upon a case, True
Some words there grew twixt Somerset and me, True
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue, True
And did upbraid me with my fathers death, True
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue, True
Else with the like I had requited him, True
Therefore good uncle for my fathers sake, True
In honour of a true Plantagenet, True
And for alliance sake declare the cause, True
My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head, True
That cause fair nephew that imprisond me, True
And hath detaind me all my flowering youth, True
Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine, True
Was cursed instrument of his decease, True
Discover more at large what cause that was, True
For I am ignorant and cannot guess, True
I will if that my fading breath permit, True
And death approach not ere my tale be done, True
Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king, True
Deposed his nephew Richard Edwards son, True
The firstbegotten and the lawful heir, True
Of Edward king the third of that descent, True
During whose reign the Percies of the north, True
Finding his usurpation most unjust, True
Endeavord my advancement to the throne, True
The reason moved these warlike lords to this, True
Was for thatyoung King Richard thus removed, True
Leaving no heir begotten of his body, True
I was the next by birth and parentage, True
For by my mother I derived am, True
From Lionel Duke of Clarence the third son, True
To King Edward the Third whereas he, True
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree, True
Being but fourth of that heroic line, True
But mark as in this haughty attempt, True
They laboured to plant the rightful heir, True
I lost my liberty and they their lives, True
Long after this when Henry the Fifth, True
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign, True
Thy father Earl of Cambridge then derived, True
From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York, True
Marrying my sister that thy mother was, True
Again in pity of my hard distress, True
Levied an army weening to redeem, True
And have installd me in the diadem, True
But as the rest so fell that noble earl, True
And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers, True
In whom the tide rested were suppressd, True
Of which my lord your honour is the last, True
True and thou seest that I no issue have, True
And that my fainting words do warrant death, True
Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather, True
But yet be wary in thy studious care, True
Thy grave admonishments prevail with me, True
But yet methinks my fathers execution, True
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny, True
With silence nephew be thou politic, True
Strongfixed is the house of Lancaster, True
And like a mountain not to be removed, True
But now thy uncle is removing hence, True
As princes do their courts when they are cloyd, True
With long continuance in a settled place, True
O uncle would some part of my young years, True
Might but redeem the passage of your age, True
Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth, True
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill, True
Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good, True
Only give order for my funeral, True
And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes, True
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war, True
And peace no war befall thy parting soul, True
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage, True
And like a hermit overpassd thy days, True
Well I will lock his counsel in my breast, True
And what I do imagine let that rest, True
Keepers convey him hence and I myself, True
Will see his burial better than his life, True
Exeunt Gaolers bearing out the body of MORTIMER, True
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer, True
Choked with ambition of the meaner sort, True
And for those wrongs those bitter injuries, True
Which Somerset hath offerd to my house, True
I doubt not but with honour to redress, True
And therefore haste I to the parliament, True

And for dissension who preferreth peace, True
More than I doexcept I be provoked, True

Myself and divers gentlemen beside, True
Were there surprised and taken prisoners, True
Then judge great lords if I have done amiss, True
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear, True
This ornament of knighthood yea or no, True
To say the truth this fact was infamous, True
And ill beseeming any common man, True

When first this order was ordaind my lords, True
Knights of the garter were of noble birth, True
Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage, True
Such as were grown to credit by the wars, True
Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress, True

Pretend some alteration in good will, True
I have upon especial cause, True
Moved with compassion of my countrys wreck, True
Together with the pitiful complaints, True
Of such as your oppression feeds upon, True
Forsaken your pernicious faction, True
And joind with Charles the rightful King of France, True
O monstrous treachery can this be so, True
That in alliance amity and oaths, True
There should be found such false dissembling guile, True
What doth my uncle Burgundy revolt, True
He doth my lord and is become your foe, True

What is that wrong whereof you both complain, True
First let me know and then Ill answer you, True
Crossing the sea from England into France, True
This fellow here with envious carping tongue, True
Upbraided me about the rose I wear, True
Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves, True
Did represent my masters blushing cheeks, True
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth, True
About a certain question in the law, True
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him, True
With other vile and ignominious terms, True
In confutation of which rude reproach, True
And in defence of my lords worthiness, True
I crave the benefit of law of arms, True
And that is my petition noble lord, True
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit, True
To set a gloss upon his bold intent, True
Yet know my lord I was provoked by him, True
And he first took exceptions at this badge, True
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower, True
Bewrayd the faintness of my masters heart, True
Will not this malice Somerset be left, True
Your private grudge my Lord of York will out, True
Though neer so cunningly you smother it, True
Good Lord what madness rules in brainsick men, True
When for so slight and frivolous a cause, True
Such factious emulations shall arise, True
Good cousins both of York and Somerset, True
Quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace, True
Let this dissension first be tried by fight, True
And then your highness shall command a peace, True

There is my pledge accept it Somerset, True
Nay let it rest where it began at first, True
Confirm it so mine honourable lord, True
Confirm it so Confounded be your strife, True
And perish ye with your audacious prate, True
Presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed, True
With this immodest clamorous outrage, True
To trouble and disturb the king and us, True
And you my lords methinks you do not well, True
To bear with their perverse objections, True
Much less to take occasion from their mouths, True
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves, True
Let me persuade you take a better course, True
It grieves his highness good my lords be friends, True
Come hither you that would be combatants, True
Henceforth I charge you as you love our favour, True
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause, True
And you my lords remember where we are, True
In France amongst a fickle wavering nation, True
If they perceive dissension in our looks, True
And that within ourselves we disagree, True
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked, True
To wilful disobedience and rebel, True
Beside what infamy will there arise, True
When foreign princes shall be certified, True
That for a toy a thing of no regard, True
King Henrys peers and chief nobility, True
Destroyd themselves and lost the realm of France, True
O think upon the conquest of my father, True
My tender years and let us not forego, True
That for a trifle that was bought with blood, True
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife, True
I see no reason if I wear this rose, True
Putting on a red rose, True
That any one should therefore be suspicious, True
I more incline to Somerset than York, True
Both are my kinsmen and I love them both, True
As well they may upbraid me with my crown, True
Because forsooth the king of Scots is crownd, True
But your discretions better can persuade, True
Than I am able to instruct or teach, True
And therefore as we hither came in peace, True
So let us still continue peace and love, True
Cousin of York we institute your grace, True
To be our regent in these parts of France, True
And good my Lord of Somerset unite, True
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot, True
And like true subjects sons of your progenitors, True
Go cheerfully together and digest, True
Your angry choler on your enemies, True
Ourself my lord protector and the rest, True
After some respite will return to Calais, True
From thence to England where I hope ere long, True
To be presented by your victories, True
With Charles Alencon and that traitorous rout, True
Flourish Exeunt all but YORK WARWICK EXETER and VERNON, True
My Lord of York I promise you the king, True
Prettily methought did play the orator, True
And so he did but yet I like it not, True
In that he wears the badge of Somerset, True
Tush that was but his fancy blame him not, True
I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm, True
An if I wist he didbut let it rest, True
Other affairs must now be managed, True

To send such peevish tokens to a king, True
Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET, True
O wert thou for myself But Suffolk stay, True
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth, True
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk, True
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise, True
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount, True
And natural graces that extinguish art, True
Repeat their semblance often on the seas, True
That when thou comest to kneel at Henrys feet, True

Thou art no father nor no friend of mine, True
Out out My lords an please you tis not so, True
I did beget her all the parish knows, True
Her mother liveth yet can testify, True
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship, True
Graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage, True
This argues what her kind of life hath been, True
Wicked and vile and so her death concludes, True
Fie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle, True
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh, True
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear, True
Deny me not I prithee gentle Joan, True
Peasant avaunt You have subornd this man, True
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth, True
Tis true I gave a noble to the priest, True
The morn that I was wedded to her mother, True
Kneel down and take my blessing good my girl, True
Wilt thou not stoop Now cursed be the time, True
Of thy nativity I would the milk, True
Thy mother gave thee when thou suckdst her breast, True
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake, True
Or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield, True
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee, True
Dost thou deny thy father cursed drab, True
O burn her burn her hanging is too good, True
Take her away for she hath lived too long, True
To fill the world with vicious qualities, True
First let me tell you whom you have condemnd, True
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain, True
But issued from the progeny of kings, True
Virtuous and holy chosen from above, True
By inspiration of celestial grace, True
To work exceeding miracles on earth, True
I never had to do with wicked spirits, True
But you that are polluted with your lusts, True
Staind with the guiltless blood of innocents, True
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices, True
Because you want the grace that others have, True
You judge it straight a thing impossible, True
To compass wonders but by help of devils, True
No misconceived Joan of Arc hath been, True
A virgin from her tender infancy, True
Chaste and immaculate in very thought, True
Whose maiden blood thus rigorously effused, True
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven, True
Ay ay away with her to execution, True
And hark ye sirs because she is a maid, True
Spare for no faggots let there be enow, True
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake, True
That so her torture may be shortened, True
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts, True
Then Joan discover thine infirmity, True
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege, True
I am with child ye bloody homicides, True
Murder not then the fruit within my womb, True
Although ye hale me to a violent death, True
Now heaven forfend the holy maid with child, True
The greatest miracle that eer ye wrought, True
Is all your strict preciseness come to this, True
She and the Dauphin have been juggling, True
I did imagine what would be her refuge, True
Well go to well have no bastards live, True
Especially since Charles must father it, True
You are deceived my child is none of his, True
It was Alencon that enjoyd my love, True
Alencon that notorious Machiavel, True
It dies an if it had a thousand lives, True
O give me leave I have deluded you, True
Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named, True
But Reignier king of Naples that prevaild, True
A married man thats most intolerable, True
Why heres a girl I think she knows not well, True
There were so many whom she may accuse, True
Its sign she hath been liberal and free, True
And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure, True
Strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee, True
Use no entreaty for it is in vain, True
Then lead me hence with whom I leave my curse, True
May never glorious sun reflex his beams, True
Upon the country where you make abode, True
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death, True
Environ you till mischief and despair, True
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves, True
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes, True
Thou foul accursed minister of hell, True
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER attended, True
Lord regent I do greet your excellence, True
With letters of commission from the king, True
For know my lords the states of Christendom, True
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils, True
Have earnestly implored a general peace, True
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French, True
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train, True
Approacheth to confer about some matter, True
Is all our travail turnd to this effect, True
After the slaughter of so many peers, True
So many captains gentlemen and soldiers, True
That in this quarrel have been overthrown, True
And sold their bodies for their countrys benefit, True
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace, True
Have we not lost most part of all the towns, True
By treason falsehood and by treachery, True
Our great progenitors had conquered, True
O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief, True
The utter loss of all the realm of France, True
Be patient York if we conclude a peace, True
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants, True
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby, True
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BASTARD OF ORLEANS REIGNIER and others, True
Since lords of England it is thus agreed, True
That peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in France, True
We come to be informed by yourselves, True
What the conditions of that league must be, True
Speak Winchester for boiling choler chokes, True
The hollow passage of my poisond voice, True
By sight of these our baleful enemies, True
Charles and the rest it is enacted thus, True
That in regard King Henry gives consent, True
Of mere compassion and of lenity, True
To ease your country of distressful war, True
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace, True
You shall become true liegemen to his crown, True
And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear, True
To pay him tribute submit thyself, True
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him, True
And still enjoy thy regal dignity, True
Must he be then as shadow of himself, True
Adorn his temples with a coronet, True
And yet in substance and authority, True
Retain but privilege of a private man, True
This proffer is absurd and reasonless, True
Tis known already that I am possessd, True
With more than half the Gallian territories, True
And therein reverenced for their lawful king, True
Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquishd, True
Detract so much from that prerogative, True
As to be calld but viceroy of the whole, True
No lord ambassador Ill rather keep, True
That which I have than coveting for more, True
Be cast from possibility of all, True
Insulting Charles hast thou by secret means, True
Used intercession to obtain a league, True
And now the matter grows to compromise, True
Standst thou aloof upon comparison, True
Either accept the title thou usurpst, True
Of benefit proceeding from our king, True
And not of any challenge of desert, True
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars, True
My lord you do not well in obstinacy, True
To cavil in the course of this contract, True
If once it be neglected ten to one, True
We shall not find like opportunity, True
To say the truth it is your policy, True
To save your subjects from such massacre, True
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen, True
By our proceeding in hostility, True
And therefore take this compact of a truce, True
Although you break it when your pleasure serves, True
How sayst thou Charles shall our condition stand, True
Only reserved you claim no interest, True
In any of our towns of garrison, True
Then swear allegiance to his majesty, True
As thou art knight never to disobey, True
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England, True
Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England, True
So now dismiss your army when ye please, True
Hang up your ensign let your drums be still, True
For here we entertain a solemn peace, True
SCENE V London The palace, True
Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI GLOUCESTER and EXETER, True
Your wondrous rare description noble earl, True
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonishd me, True
Her virtues graced with external gifts, True
Do breed loves settled passions in my heart, True
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts, True
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide, True
So am I driven by breath of her renown, True
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive, True
Where I may have fruition of her love, True
Tush my good lord this superficial tale, True
Is but a preface of her worthy praise, True
The chief perfections of that lovely dame, True
Had I sufficient skill to utter them, True
Would make a volume of enticing lines, True
Able to ravish any dull conceit, True
And which is more she is not so divine, True
So fullreplete with choice of all delights, True
But with as humble lowliness of mind, True
She is content to be at your command, True
Command I mean of virtuous chaste intents, True
To love and honour Henry as her lord, True
And otherwise will Henry neer presume, True
Therefore my lord protector give consent, True
That Margaret may be Englands royal queen, True
So should I give consent to flatter sin, True
You know my lord your highness is betrothd, True
Unto another lady of esteem, True
How shall we then dispense with that contract, True
And not deface your honour with reproach, True
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths, True
Or one that at a triumph having vowd, True
To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists, True
By reason of his adversarys odds, True
A poor earls daughter is unequal odds, True
And therefore may be broke without offence, True
Why what I pray is Margaret more than that, True
Her father is no better than an earl, True
Although in glorious titles he excel, True
Yes lord her father is a king, True
The King of Naples and Jerusalem, True
And of such great authority in France, True
As his alliance will confirm our peace, True
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance, True
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do, True
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles, True
Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower, True
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give, True
A dower my lords disgrace not so your king, True
That he should be so abject base and poor, True
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love, True
Henry is able to enrich his queen, True
And not seek a queen to make him rich, True
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives, True
As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse, True
Marriage is a matter of more worth, True
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship, True
Not whom we will but whom his grace affects, True
Must be companion of his nuptial bed, True
And therefore lords since he affects her most, True
It most of all these reasons bindeth us, True
In our opinions she should be preferrd, True
For what is wedlock forced but a hell, True
An age of discord and continual strife, True
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss, True
And is a pattern of celestial peace, True
Whom should we match with Henry being a king, True
But Margaret that is daughter to a king, True
Her peerless feature joined with her birth, True
Approves her fit for none but for a king, True
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit, True
More than in women commonly is seen, True
Will answer our hope in issue of a king, True
For Henry son unto a conqueror, True
Is likely to beget more conquerors, True
If with a lady of so high resolve, True
As is fair Margaret he be linkd in love, True
Then yield my lords and here conclude with me, True
That Margaret shall be queen and none but she, True
Whether it be through force of your report, True
My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that, True
My tender youth was never yet attaint, True
With any passion of inflaming love, True
I cannot tell but this I am assured, True
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast, True
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear, True
As I am sick with working of my thoughts, True
Take therefore shipping post my lord to France, True
Agree to any covenants and procure, True
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come, True
To cross the seas to England and be crownd, True
King Henrys faithful and anointed queen, True
For your expenses and sufficient charge, True
Among the people gather up a tenth, True
Be gone I say for till you do return, True
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares, True
And you good uncle banish all offence, True
If you do censure me by what you were, True
Not what you are I know it will excuse, True
This sudden execution of my will, True
And so conduct me where from company, True
I may revolve and ruminate my grief, True
Ay grief I fear me both at first and last, True
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER, True
Thus Suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes, True
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece, True
With hope to find the like event in love, True
But prosper better than the Trojan did, True
Margaret shall now be queen and rule the king, True
But I will rule both her the king and realm, True
