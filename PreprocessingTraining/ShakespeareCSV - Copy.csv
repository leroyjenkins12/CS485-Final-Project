O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend, True
The brightest heaven of invention,, True
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, True
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!, True
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,, True
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,, True
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire, True
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,, True
The flat unraised spirits that have dared, True
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth, True
So great an object: can this cockpit hold, True
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram, True
Within this wooden O the very casques, True
That did affright the air at Agincourt?, True
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may, True
Attest in little place a million;, True
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,, True
On your imaginary forces work., True
Suppose within the girdle of these walls, True
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,, True
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts, True
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:, True
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;, True
Into a thousand parts divide on man,, True
And make imaginary puissance;, True
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them, True
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;, True
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,, True
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,, True
Turning the accomplishment of many years, True
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,, True

SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace., True
, True
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,, True
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign, True
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,, True
But that the scambling and unquiet time, True
Did push it out of farther question., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,, True
We lose the better half of our possession:, True
For all the temporal lands which men devout, True
By testament have given to the church, True
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:, True
As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,, True
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,, True
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;, True
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,, True
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil., True
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;, True
And to the coffers of the king beside,, True
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
This would drink deep., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
'Twould drink the cup and all., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
But what prevention?, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
The king is full of grace and fair regard., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
And a true lover of the holy church., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
The courses of his youth promised it not., True
The breath no sooner left his father's body,, True
But that his wildness, mortified in him,, True
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment, True
Consideration, like an angel, came, True
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,, True
Leaving his body as a paradise,, True
To envelop and contain celestial spirits., True
Never was such a sudden scholar made;, True
Never came reformation in a flood,, True
With such a heady currance, scouring faults, True
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness, True
So soon did lose his seat and all at once, True
As in this king., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
We are blessed in the change., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
Hear him but reason in divinity,, True
And all-admiring with an inward wish, True
You would desire the king were made a prelate:, True
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,, True
You would say it hath been all in all his study:, True
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear, True
A fearful battle render'd you in music:, True
Turn him to any cause of policy,, True
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,, True
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,, True
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,, True
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,, True
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;, True
So that the art and practic part of life, True
Must be the mistress to this theoric:, True
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,, True
Since his addiction was to courses vain,, True
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,, True
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,, True
And never noted in him any study,, True
Any retirement, any sequestration, True
From open haunts and popularity., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle, True
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best, True
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:, True
And so the prince obscured his contemplation, True
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,, True
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,, True
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;, True
And therefore we must needs admit the means, True
How things are perfected., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
But, my good lord,, True
How now for mitigation of this bill, True
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty, True
Incline to it, or no?, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
He seems indifferent,, True
Or rather swaying more upon our part, True
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;, True
For I have made an offer to his majesty,, True
Upon our spiritual convocation, True
And in regard of causes now in hand,, True
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,, True
As touching France, to give a greater sum, True
Than ever at one time the clergy yet, True
Did to his predecessors part withal., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
How did this offer seem received, my lord?, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
With good acceptance of his majesty;, True
Save that there was not time enough to hear,, True
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,, True
The severals and unhidden passages, True
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms, True
And generally to the crown and seat of France, True
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
What was the impediment that broke this off?, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
The French ambassador upon that instant, True
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come, True
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?, True
, True
ELY, True
, True
It is., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
Then go we in, to know his embassy;, True
Which I could with a ready guess declare,, True
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it., True
, True
ELY, True
, True
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it., True
, True
Exeunt, True

SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber., True

KING HENRY V, True

Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?, True
, True

Not here in presence., True

KING HENRY V, True
, True
Send for him, good uncle., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,, True
Before we hear him, of some things of weight, True
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France., True
, True
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
God and his angels guard your sacred throne, True
And make you long become it!, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Sure, we thank you., True
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed, True
And justly and religiously unfold, True
Why the law Salique that they have in France, True
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:, True
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,, True
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,, True
Or nicely charge your understanding soul, True
With opening titles miscreate, whose right, True
Suits not in native colours with the truth;, True
For God doth know how many now in health, True
Shall drop their blood in approbation, True
Of what your reverence shall incite us to., True
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,, True
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:, True
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;, True
For never two such kingdoms did contend, True
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops, True
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint, True
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords, True
That make such waste in brief mortality., True
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;, True
For we will hear, note and believe in heart, True
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd, True
As pure as sin with baptism., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,, True
That owe yourselves, your lives and services, True
To this imperial throne. There is no bar, True
To make against your highness' claim to France, True
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,, True
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:', True
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:', True
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze, True
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond, True
The founder of this law and female bar., True
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm, True
That the land Salique is in Germany,, True
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;, True
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,, True
There left behind and settled certain French;, True
Who, holding in disdain the German women, True
For some dishonest manners of their life,, True
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female, True
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:, True
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,, True
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen., True
Then doth it well appear that Salique law, True
Was not devised for the realm of France:, True
Nor did the French possess the Salique land, True
Until four hundred one and twenty years, True
After defunction of King Pharamond,, True
Idly supposed the founder of this law;, True
Who died within the year of our redemption, True
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great, True
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French, True
Beyond the river Sala, in the year, True
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,, True
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,, True
Did, as heir general, being descended, True
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,, True
Make claim and title to the crown of France., True
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown, True
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male, True
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,, True
To find his title with some shows of truth,, True
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,, True
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,, True
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son, True
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son, True
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,, True
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,, True
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,, True
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied, True
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,, True
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,, True
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:, True
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great, True
Was re-united to the crown of France., True
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun., True
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,, True
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear, True
To hold in right and title of the female:, True
So do the kings of France unto this day;, True
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law, True
To bar your highness claiming from the female,, True
And rather choose to hide them in a net, True
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles, True
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
May I with right and conscience make this claim?, True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!, True
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,, True
When the man dies, let the inheritance, True
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,, True
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;, True
Look back into your mighty ancestors:, True
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,, True
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,, True
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,, True
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,, True
Making defeat on the full power of France,, True
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill, True
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp, True
Forage in blood of French nobility., True
O noble English. that could entertain, True
With half their forces the full Pride of France, True
And let another half stand laughing by,, True
All out of work and cold for action!, True
, True
ELY, True
, True
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead, True
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:, True
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;, True
The blood and courage that renowned them, True
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege, True
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,, True
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises., True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth, True
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,, True
As did the former lions of your blood., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
They know your grace hath cause and means and might;, True
So hath your highness; never king of England, True
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,, True
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England, True
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,, True
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;, True
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty, True
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum, True
As never did the clergy at one time, True
Bring in to any of your ancestors., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
We must not only arm to invade the French,, True
But lay down our proportions to defend, True
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us, True
With all advantages., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
They of those marches, gracious sovereign,, True
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend, True
Our inland from the pilfering borderers., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,, True
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,, True
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;, True
For you shall read that my great-grandfather, True
Never went with his forces into France, True
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom, True
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,, True
With ample and brim fulness of his force,, True
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,, True
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;, True
That England, being empty of defence,, True
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;, True
For hear her but exampled by herself:, True
When all her chivalry hath been in France, True
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,, True
She hath herself not only well defended, True
But taken and impounded as a stray, True
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,, True
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings, True
And make her chronicle as rich with praise, True
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea, True
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
But there's a saying very old and true,, True
'If that you will France win,, True
Then with Scotland first begin:', True
For once the eagle England being in prey,, True
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot, True
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,, True
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,, True
To tear and havoc more than she can eat., True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
It follows then the cat must stay at home:, True
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,, True
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,, True
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves., True
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,, True
The advised head defends itself at home;, True
For government, though high and low and lower,, True
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,, True
Congreeing in a full and natural close,, True
Like music., True
, True
CANTERBURY, True
, True
Therefore doth heaven divide, True
The state of man in divers functions,, True
Setting endeavour in continual motion;, True
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,, True
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,, True
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach, True
The act of order to a peopled kingdom., True
They have a king and officers of sorts;, True
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,, True
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,, True
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,, True
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,, True
Which pillage they with merry march bring home, True
To the tent-royal of their emperor;, True
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys, True
The singing masons building roofs of gold,, True
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,, True
The poor mechanic porters crowding in, True
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,, True
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,, True
Delivering o'er to executors pale, True
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,, True
That many things, having full reference, True
To one consent, may work contrariously:, True
As many arrows, loosed several ways,, True
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;, True
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;, True
As many lines close in the dial's centre;, True
So may a thousand actions, once afoot., True
End in one purpose, and be all well borne, True
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege., True
Divide your happy England into four;, True
Whereof take you one quarter into France,, True
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake., True
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,, True
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,, True
Let us be worried and our nation lose, True
The name of hardiness and policy., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin., True
, True
Exeunt some Attendants, True
Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,, True
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,, True
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,, True
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,, True
Ruling in large and ample empery, True
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,, True
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,, True
Tombless, with no remembrance over them:, True
Either our history shall with full mouth, True
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,, True
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,, True
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph., True
, True
Enter Ambassadors of France, True
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure, True
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear, True
Your greeting is from him, not from the king., True
, True
First Ambassador, True
, True
May't please your majesty to give us leave, True
Freely to render what we have in charge;, True
Or shall we sparingly show you far off, True
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;, True
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject, True
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:, True
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness, True
Tell us the Dauphin's mind., True
, True
First Ambassador, True
, True
Thus, then, in few., True
Your highness, lately sending into France,, True
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right, True
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third., True
In answer of which claim, the prince our master, True
Says that you savour too much of your youth,, True
And bids you be advised there's nought in France, True
That can be with a nimble galliard won;, True
You cannot revel into dukedoms there., True
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,, True
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,, True
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim, True
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
What treasure, uncle?, True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
Tennis-balls, my liege., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;, True
His present and your pains we thank you for:, True
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,, True
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set, True
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard., True
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler, True
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd, True
With chaces. And we understand him well,, True
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,, True
Not measuring what use we made of them., True
We never valued this poor seat of England;, True
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself, True
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common, True
That men are merriest when they are from home., True
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,, True
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness, True
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:, True
For that I have laid by my majesty, True
And plodded like a man for working-days,, True
But I will rise there with so full a glory, True
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,, True
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us., True
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his, True
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul, True
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance, True
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows, True
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;, True
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;, True
And some are yet ungotten and unborn, True
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn., True
But this lies all within the will of God,, True
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name, True
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,, True
To venge me as I may and to put forth, True
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause., True
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin, True
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,, True
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it., True
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well., True
, True
Exeunt Ambassadors, True
, True
EXETER, True

This was a merry message., True

KING HENRY V, True

We hope to make the sender blush at it., True
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour, True
That may give furtherance to our expedition;, True
For we have now no thought in us but France,, True
Save those to God, that run before our business., True
Therefore let our proportions for these wars, True
Be soon collected and all things thought upon, True
That may with reasonable swiftness add, True
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,, True
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door., True
Therefore let every man now task his thought,, True
That this fair action may on foot be brought., True

One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,, True
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,, True

All other devils that suggest by treasons, True
Do botch and bungle up damnation, True

The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;, True
And he is bred out of that bloody strain, True
That haunted us in our familiar paths:, True
Witness our too much memorable shame, True
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,, True
And all our princes captiv'd by the hand, True
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;, True
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,, True
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,, True
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,, True
Mangle the work of nature and deface, True
The patterns that by God and by French fathers, True
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem, True
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear, True
The native mightiness and fate of him., True

, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs, True
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten, True
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,, True
Take up the English short, and let them know, True
Of what a monarchy you are the head:, True
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin, True
As self-neglecting., True

From our brother England?, True

From him; and thus he greets your majesty., True
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,, True
That you divest yourself, and lay apart, True
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,, True
By law of nature and of nations, 'long, True
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown, True
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain, True
By custom and the ordinance of times, True
Unto the crown of France. That you may know, True
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,, True
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,, True
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,, True
He sends you this most memorable line,, True
In every branch truly demonstrative;, True
Willing to overlook this pedigree:, True
And when you find him evenly derived, True
From his most famed of famous ancestors,, True
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign, True
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held, True
From him the native and true challenger., True
, True
KING OF FRANCE, True
, True
Or else what follows?, True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown, True
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:, True
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,, True
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,, True
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;, True
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,, True
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy, True
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war, True
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head, True
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries, True
The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,, True
For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,, True
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy., True
This is his claim, his threatening and my message;, True
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,, True
To whom expressly I bring greeting too., True

For us, we will consider of this further:, True
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent, True

For the Dauphin,, True
I stand here for him: what to him from England?, True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,, True
And any thing that may not misbecome, True
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at., True
Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness, True
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,, True
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,, True
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,, True
That caves and womby vaultages of France, True
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock, True
In second accent of his ordnance., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Say, if my father render fair return,, True
It is against my will; for I desire, True
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,, True
As matching to his youth and vanity,, True
I did present him with the Paris balls., True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,, True
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:, True
And, be assured, you'll find a difference,, True
As we his subjects have in wonder found,, True
Between the promise of his greener days, True
And these he masters now: now he weighs time, True
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read, True
In your own losses, if he stay in France., True

To-morrow shall you know our mind at full., True

Chorus, True
, True
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies, True
In motion of no less celerity, True
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen, True
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier, True
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet, True
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:, True
Play with your fancies, and in them behold, True
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;, True
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give, True
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,, True
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,, True
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,, True
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think, True
You stand upon the ravage and behold, True
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;, True
For so appears this fleet majestical,, True
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:, True
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,, True
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,, True
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,, True
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;, True
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd, True
With one appearing hair, that will not follow, True
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?, True
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;, True
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,, True
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur., True
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;, True
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him, True
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,, True
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms., True
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner, True
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,, True

Alarum, and chambers go off, True
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,, True

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;, True
Or close the wall up with our English dead., True
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man, True
As modest stillness and humility:, True
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,, True
Then imitate the action of the tiger;, True
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,, True
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;, True
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;, True
Let pry through the portage of the head, True
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it, True
As fearfully as doth a galled rock, True
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,, True
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean., True
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,, True
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit, True
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English., True
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!, True
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,, True
Have in these parts from morn till even fought, True
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:, True
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest, True
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you., True
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,, True
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,, True
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here, True
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear, True
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;, True
For there is none of you so mean and base,, True
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes., True
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,, True
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:, True
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge, True

Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;, True

the humour of it is too hot, that is the very, True
plain-song of it., True

PISTOL, True

The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:, True

And sword and shield,, True

, True
Boy, True
, True
As young as I am, I have observed these three, True
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they, True
three, though they would serve me, could not be man, True
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to, True
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and, True
red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but, True
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue, True
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks, True
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath, True
heard that men of few words are the best men; and, True
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a', True
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words, True
are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never, True
broke any man's head but his own, and that was, True
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal, True
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a, True
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for, True
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn, True
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a, True
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the, True
men would carry coals. They would have me as, True
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their, True
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,, True
if I should take from another's pocket to put into, True
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I, True
must leave them, and seek some better service:, True
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and, True
therefore I must cast it up., True

To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good, True
to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is, True
not according to the disciplines of the war: the, True
concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,, True
the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look, True
you, is digt himself four yard under the, True

all, if there is not better directions., True

Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,, True
that is certain; and of great expedition and, True
knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular, True
knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will, True
maintain his argument as well as any military man in, True

It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the, True
day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the, True
king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The, True
town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the, True
breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:, True
'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to, True
stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is, True
throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there, True
ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!, True

Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,, True
and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish, True
my nation? Who talks of my nation?, True
, True
FLUELLEN, True
, True
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is, True
meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think, True
you do not use me with that affability as in, True
discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as, True
good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of, True
war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in, True
other particularities., True

This is the latest parle we will admit;, True
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;, True
Or like to men proud of destruction, True
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,, True
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,, True
If I begin the battery once again,, True
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur, True
Till in her ashes she lie buried., True
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,, True
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,, True
In liberty of bloody hand shall range, True
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass, True
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants., True
What is it then to me, if impious war,, True
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,, True

Enlink'd to waste and desolation?, True
What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,, True
If your pure maidens fall into the hand, True
Of hot and forcing violation?, True
What rein can hold licentious wickedness, True
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?, True
We may as bootless spend our vain command, True
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil, True

To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,, True
Take pity of your town and of your people,, True
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;, True

Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;, True
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,, True
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,, True
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,, True
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused, True
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry, True

And give our vineyards to a barbarous people., True

O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,, True
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,, True
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,, True
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,, True
And overlook their grafters?, True

Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!, True

In that nook-shotten isle of Albion., True

Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?, True
Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,, True
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,, True
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,, True
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,, True
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?, True
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,, True
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,, True
Let us not hang like roping icicles, True
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people, True
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!, True
Poor we may call them in their native lords., True

By faith and honour,, True
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say, True
Our mettle is bred out and they will give, True
Their bodies to the lust of English youth, True

committed at the bridge., True

Is the Duke of Exeter safe?, True

FLUELLEN, True
, True
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;, True
and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my, True
heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and, True
my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and, True
blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the, True
bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline., True
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the, True
pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as, True
valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no, True
estimation in the world; but did see him do as, True
gallant service., True
, True
GOWER, True
, True
What do you call him?, True
, True

He is called Aunchient Pistol., True

Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:, True
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well., True

his hands., True

Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,, True
And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,, True
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,, True
That goddess blind,, True
That stands upon the rolling restless stone--, True
, True
FLUELLEN, True
, True
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is, True
painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to, True
signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is, True
painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which, True
is the moral of it, that she is turning, and, True
inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her, True
foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,, True
which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,, True
the poet makes a most excellent description of it:, True
Fortune is an excellent moral., True
, True
PISTOL, True
, True
Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;, True
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:, True
A damned death!, True
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free, True
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:, True
But Exeter hath given the doom of death, True
For pax of little price., True
Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:, True
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut, True
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:, True
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite., True

Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning., True
, True
PISTOL, True
, True
Why then, rejoice therefore., True
, True
FLUELLEN, True
, True
Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice, True
at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would, True
desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put, True
him to execution; for discipline ought to be used., True

I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the, True
bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it, True
is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,, True
I warrant you, when time is serve., True
, True
GOWER, True
, True
Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then, True
goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return, True
into London under the form of a soldier. And such, True
fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:, True
and they will learn you by rote where services were, True
done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,, True
at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was, True
shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;, True
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,, True
which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what, True
a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of, True
the camp will do among foaming bottles and, True
ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But, True
you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or, True
else you may be marvellously mistook., True
, True
FLUELLEN, True
, True
I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is, True
not the man that he would gladly make show to the, True
world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will, True
tell him my mind., True

Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with, True
him from the pridge., True

How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?, True
, True
FLUELLEN, True
, True
Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has, True
very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is, True
gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most, True
prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have, True
possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to, True
retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the, True
pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a, True
prave man., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
What men have you lost, Fluellen?, True
, True
FLUELLEN, True
, True
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very, True
great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I, True
think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that, True
is like to be executed for robbing a church, one, True
Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is, True
all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o', True
fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like, True
a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;, True
but his nose is executed and his fire's out., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we, True
give express charge, that in our marches through the, True
country, there be nothing compelled from the, True
villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the, True
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;, True
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the, True
gentler gamester is the soonest winner., True

MONTJOY, True

Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:, True
Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage, True
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we, True
could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we, True
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were, True
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice, True
is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see, True
his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him, True
therefore consider of his ransom; which must, True
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we, True
have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in, True
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under., True
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the, True
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too, True
faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own, True
person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and, True
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and, True
tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his, True
followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far, True
my king and master; so much my office., True

KING HENRY V, True

Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back., True
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;, True
But could be willing to march on to Calais, True
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,, True
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much, True
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,, True
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,, True
My numbers lessened, and those few I have, True
Almost no better than so many French;, True
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,, True
I thought upon one pair of English legs, True
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,, True
That I do brag thus! This your air of France, True
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent., True
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;, True
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,, True
My army but a weak and sickly guard;, True
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,, True
Though France himself and such another neighbour, True
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy., True
Go bid thy master well advise himself:, True
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,, True
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood, True
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well., True
The sum of all our answer is but this:, True
We would not seek a battle, as we are;, True
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:, True

Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!, True

You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due., True

Will it never be morning?, True

My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you, True
talk of horse and armour?, True

ORLEANS, True
, True
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
What a long night is this! I will not change my, True
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns., True
Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his, True
entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,, True
chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I, True
soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth, True
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his, True
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes., True
, True
ORLEANS, True
, True
He's of the colour of the nutmeg., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for, True
Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull, True
elements of earth and water never appear in him, but, True
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts, True
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you, True
may call beasts., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the, True
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage., True
, True
ORLEANS, True
, True
No more, cousin., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the, True
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary, True
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as, True
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent, True
tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:, True
'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for, True
a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the, True
world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart, True
their particular functions and wonder at him. I, True
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:, True
'Wonder of nature,'--, True
, True
ORLEANS, True
, True
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my, True
courser, for my horse is my mistress., True
, True
ORLEANS, True
, True
Your mistress bears well., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Me well; which is the prescript praise and, True
perfection of a good and particular mistress., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly, True
shook your back., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
So perhaps did yours., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
Mine was not bridled., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,, True
like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in, True
your straight strossers., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
You have good judgment in horsemanship., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride, True
not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have, True
my horse to my mistress., True

I had as lief have my mistress a jade., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair., True

to my mistress., True

'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et, True
la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing., True

such proverb so little kin to the purpose., True

RAMBURES, True

My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent, True
to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?, True

Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
And yet my sky shall not want., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and, True
'twere more honour some were away., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
Even as your horse bears your praises; who would, True
trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted., True
, True
DAUPHIN, True
, True
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will, True
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and, True
my way shall be paved with English faces., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of, True
my way: but I would it were morning; for I would, True
fain be about the ears of the English., True

He never did harm, that I heard of., True

Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared, True

He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him., True
, True
Constable, True

By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it, True

appears, it will bate., True

I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.', True

And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.', True

Well placed: there stands your friend for the, True
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A, True
pox of the devil.', True

If the English had any apprehension, they would run away., True

That island of England breeds very valiant, True
creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage., True

Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a, True
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like, True
rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a, True
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion., True
, True
Constable, True
, True
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the, True
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving, True
their wits with their wives: and then give them, True

Chorus, True

Now entertain conjecture of a time, True
When creeping murmur and the poring dark, True
Fills the wide vessel of the universe., True
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night, True
The hum of either army stilly sounds,, True
That the fixed sentinels almost receive, True
The secret whispers of each other's watch:, True
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames, True
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;, True
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs, True
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents, True
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,, True
With busy hammers closing rivets up,, True
Give dreadful note of preparation:, True
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,, True
And the third hour of drowsy morning name., True
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,, True
The confident and over-lusty French, True
Do the low-rated English play at dice;, True
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night, True
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp, True
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,, True
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires, True
Sit patiently and inly ruminate, True
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad, True
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats, True
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon, True
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold, True
The royal captain of this ruin'd band, True
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,, True
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!', True
For forth he goes and visits all his host., True
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile, True
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen., True
Upon his royal face there is no note, True
How dread an army hath enrounded him;, True
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour, True
Unto the weary and all-watched night,, True
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint, True
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;, True
That every wretch, pining and pale before,, True
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:, True
A largess universal like the sun, True
His liberal eye doth give to every one,, True
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,, True
Behold, as may unworthiness define,, True
A little touch of Harry in the night., True
And so our scene must to the battle fly;, True
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace, True

examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall, True
find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle, True
nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,, True

WILLIAMS, True
, True
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I, True
pray you, what thinks he of our estate?, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be, True
washed off the next tide., True
, True
BATES, True
, True
He hath not told his thought to the king?, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I, True
speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I, True
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the, True
element shows to him as it doth to me; all his, True
senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies, True
laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and, True
though his affections are higher mounted than ours,, True
yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like, True
wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we, True
do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish, True
as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess, True
him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing, True
it, should dishearten his army., True
, True
BATES, True
, True
He may show what outward courage he will; but I, True
believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish, True
himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he, True
were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:, True
I think he would not wish himself any where but, True
where he is., True
, True
BATES, True
, True
Then I would he were here alone; so should he be, True
sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here, True
alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's, True
minds: methinks I could not die any where so, True
contented as in the king's company; his cause being, True
just and his quarrel honourable., True
, True
WILLIAMS, True
, True
That's more than we know., True
, True
BATES, True
, True
Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know, True
enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if, True
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes, True
the crime of it out of us., True
, True
WILLIAMS, True
, True
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath, True
a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and, True
arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join, True
together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at, True
such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a, True
surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind, True
them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their, True
children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die, True
well that die in a battle; for how can they, True
charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their, True
argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it, True
will be a black matter for the king that led them to, True
it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of, True
subjection., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
So, if a son that is by his father sent about, True
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the, True
imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be, True
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a, True
servant, under his master's command transporting a, True
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in, True
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the, True
business of the master the author of the servant's, True
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not, True
bound to answer the particular endings of his, True
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of, True
his servant; for they purpose not their death, when, True
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no, True
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to, True
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all, True
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them, True
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;, True
some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of, True
perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that, True
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with, True
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have, True
defeated the law and outrun native punishment,, True
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to, True
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;, True
so that here men are punished for before-breach of, True
the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where, True
they feared the death, they have borne life away;, True
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if, True
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of, True
their damnation than he was before guilty of those, True
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every, True
subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's, True
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in, True
the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every, True
mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death, True
is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was, True
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:, True
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think, True
that, making God so free an offer, He let him, True
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach, True
others how they should prepare., True
, True
WILLIAMS, True
, True
'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon, True
his own head, the king is not to answer it., True
, True
BATES, True
, True
But I do not desire he should answer for me; and, True
yet I determine to fight lustily for him., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed., True
, True
WILLIAMS, True
, True
Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but, True
when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we, True
ne'er the wiser., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after., True
, True
WILLIAMS, True
, True
You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an, True
elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can, True
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to, True
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a, True
peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word, True
after! come, 'tis a foolish saying., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Your reproof is something too round: I should be, True
angry with you, if the time were convenient., True
, True

Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live., True

How shall I know thee again?, True

bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I, True
will make it my quarrel., True

This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come, True
to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,', True

, True
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it., True

Thou darest as well be hanged., True

Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to, True

shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut, True

be a clipper., True

Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at, True
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is, True
out of my prains what is the name of the other, True
river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is, True
to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you, True
mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life, True
is come after it indifferent well; for there is, True
figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and, True
you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his, True
wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his, True
displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a, True

Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his, True
ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in, True
his right wits and his good judgments, turned away, True

The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,, True
Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am, True
glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if, True
thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king, True
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my, True
crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but, True
directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me, True
farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out, True
my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so, True
clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?, True
, True
KATHARINE, True
, True
Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for, True
your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I, True
have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I, True
have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable, True
measure in strength. If I could win a lady at, True
leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my, True
armour on my back, under the correction of bragging, True
be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife., True
Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse, True
for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and, True
sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,, True
Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my, True
eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;, True
only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,, True
nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a, True
fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth, True
sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love, True
of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy, True
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst, True
love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee, True
that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the, True
Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou, True
livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and, True
uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee, True
right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other, True
places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that, True
can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do, True
always reason themselves out again. What! a, True
speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A, True
good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a, True
black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow, True
bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax, True
hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the, True
moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it, True
shines bright and never changes, but keeps his, True
course truly. If thou would have such a one, take, True
me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,, True
take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?, True
speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee., True

No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of, True
France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love, True
the friend of France; for I love France so well that, True
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it, True
all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am, True
yours, then yours is France and you are mine., True

wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook, True
off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand, True
vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what, True
then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est, True
France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,, True
Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much, True
more French: I shall never move thee in French,, True
unless it be to laugh at me., True

No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my, True
tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs, True
be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou, True
understand thus much English, canst thou love me?, True

Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask, True
them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,, True
when you come into your closet, you'll question this, True
gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to, True
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with, True
your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the, True
rather, gentle princess, because I love thee, True
cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a, True
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get, True
thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs, True
prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,, True
between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a, True
boy, half French, half English, that shall go to, True
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?, True
shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair, True
flower-de-luce?, True
, True
KATHARINE, True
, True
I do not know dat, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do, True
but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your, True
French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety, True
take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer, True
you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher, True
et devin deesse?, True

KING HENRY V, True
, True
Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in, True
true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I, True
dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to, True
flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor, True
and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew, True
my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars, True
when he got me: therefore was I created with a, True
stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when, True
I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,, True
Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:, True
my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of, True
beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou, True
hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou, True
shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:, True
and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you, True
have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the, True
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;, True
take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am, True
thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine, True
ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is, True
thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry, True
Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before, True
his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,, True
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows., True
Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is, True
music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of, True
all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken, True
English; wilt thou have me?, True

O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear, True
Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak, True
list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of, True
manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our, True
places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will, True
do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your, True
country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently, True
and yielding., True

Kissing her, True
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is, True

God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you, True

I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how, True
perfectly I love her; and that is good English., True
, True
BURGUNDY, True
, True
Is she not apt?, True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not, True
smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the, True
heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up, True
the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in, True
his true likeness., True
, True
BURGUNDY, True
, True
Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you, True
for that. If you would conjure in her, you must, True
make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true, True
likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you, True
blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the, True
virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the, True
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing, True
self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid, True
to consign to., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces., True
, True
BURGUNDY, True
, True
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not, True
what they do., True
, True
KING HENRY V, True
, True
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking., True
, True
BURGUNDY, True
, True
I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will, True
teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well, True
summered and warm kept, are like flies at, True
Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their, True
eyes; and then they will endure handling, which, True
before would not abide looking on., True
, True

and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the, True
latter end and she must be blind too., True

This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;, True
Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:', True
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:, True
But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,, True
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,, True
Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.', True
, True
MORTON, True
, True
Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;, True
But, for my lord your son--, True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
Why, he is dead., True
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!, True
He that but fears the thing he would not know, True
Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes, True
That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;, True
Tell thou an earl his divination lies,, True
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace, True
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong., True
, True
MORTON, True
, True
You are too great to be by me gainsaid:, True
Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain., True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead., True
I see a strange confession in thine eye:, True
Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin, True
To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;, True
The tongue offends not that reports his death:, True
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,, True
Not he which says the dead is not alive., True
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news, True
Hath but a losing office, and his tongue, True
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,, True
Remember'd tolling a departing friend., True
, True
LORD BARDOLPH, True
, True
I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead., True
, True
MORTON, True
, True
I am sorry I should force you to believe, True
That which I would to God I had not seen;, True
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,, True
Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,, True
To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down, True
The never-daunted Percy to the earth,, True
From whence with life he never more sprung up., True
In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire, True
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,, True
Being bruited once, took fire and heat away, True
From the best temper'd courage in his troops;, True
For from his metal was his party steel'd;, True
Which once in him abated, all the rest, True
Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:, True
And as the thing that's heavy in itself,, True
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,, True
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,, True
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear, True
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim, True
Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,, True
Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester, True
Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,, True
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword, True
Had three times slain the appearance of the king,, True
'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame, True
Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,, True
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all, True
Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out, True
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,, True
Under the conduct of young Lancaster, True
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full., True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
For this I shall have time enough to mourn., True
In poison there is physic; and these news,, True
Having been well, that would have made me sick,, True
Being sick, have in some measure made me well:, True
And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,, True
Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,, True
Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire, True
Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,, True
Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,, True
Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!, True
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel, True
Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!, True
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head, True
Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit., True
Now bind my brows with iron; and approach, True
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring, True
To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!, True
Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand, True
Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!, True
And let this world no longer be a stage, True
To feed contention in a lingering act;, True
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain, True
Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set, True
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,, True
And darkness be the burier of the dead!, True

Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour., True

MORTON, True
, True
The lives of all your loving complices, True
Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er, True
To stormy passion, must perforce decay., True
You cast the event of war, my noble lord,, True
And summ'd the account of chance, before you said, True
'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,, True
That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:, True
You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,, True
More likely to fall in than to get o'er;, True
You were advised his flesh was capable, True
Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit, True
Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:, True
Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,, True
Though strongly apprehended, could restrain, True
The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,, True
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,, True
More than that being which was like to be?, True
, True
LORD BARDOLPH, True
, True
We all that are engaged to this loss, True
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas, True
That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;, True
And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed, True
Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;, True
And since we are o'erset, venture again., True
Come, we will all put forth, body and goods., True
, True
MORTON, True
, True
'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,, True
I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,, True
The gentle Archbishop of York is up, True
With well-appointed powers: he is a man, True
Who with a double surety binds his followers., True
My lord your son had only but the corpse,, True
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;, True
For that same word, rebellion, did divide, True
The action of their bodies from their souls;, True
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,, True
As men drink potions, that their weapons only, True
Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,, True
This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,, True
As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop, True
Turns insurrection to religion:, True
Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,, True
He's followed both with body and with mind;, True
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood, True
Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;, True
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;, True
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,, True
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;, True
And more and less do flock to follow him., True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,, True
This present grief had wiped it from my mind., True
Go in with me; and counsel every man, True

Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:, True
Never so few, and never yet more need., True

, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?, True
, True
Page, True
, True
He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy, True
water; but, for the party that owed it, he might, True
have more diseases than he knew for., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the, True
brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not, True
able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more, True
than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only, True
witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other, True
men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that, True
hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the, True
prince put thee into my service for any other reason, True
than to set me off, why then I have no judgment., True
Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn, True
in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never, True
manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you, True
neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and, True
send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--, True
the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is, True
not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in, True
the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his, True
cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is, True
a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis, True
not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a, True
face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence, True
out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had, True
writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He, True
may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,, True
I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about, True
the satin for my short cloak and my slops?, True
, True
Page, True
, True
He said, sir, you should procure him better, True
assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his, True
band and yours; he liked not the security., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his, True
tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally, True
yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,, True
and then stand upon security! The whoreson, True
smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and, True
bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is, True
through with them in honest taking up, then they, True
must stand upon security. I had as lief they would, True
put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with, True
security. I looked a' should have sent me two and, True
twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he, True
sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;, True
for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness, True
of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he, True
see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him., True
Where's Bardolph?, True

, True
He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse., True

I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in, True

stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived., True

Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the, True
Prince for striking him about Bardolph., True

Lord Chief-Justice He that was in question for the robbery?, True
, True
Servant, True

He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at, True
Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some, True
charge to the Lord John of Lancaster., True

Sir John!, True

What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not, True
wars? is there not employment? doth not the king, True
lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?, True
Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it, True
is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,, True
were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell, True
how to make it., True
, True
Servant, True
, True
You mistake me, sir., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True

Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting, True
my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied, True
in my throat, if I had said so., True
, True
Servant, True
, True
I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our, True
soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,, True
you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other, True
than an honest man., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that, True
which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,, True
hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be, True
hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!, True
, True
Servant, True

Sir, my lord would speak with you., True
Lord Chief-Justice Sir John Falstaff, a word with you., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
My good lord! God give your lordship good time of, True
day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard, True
say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship, True
goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not, True
clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in, True
you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must, True
humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care, True
of your health., True
Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to, True
Shrewsbury., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is, True
returned with some discomfort from Wales., True
Lord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when, True
I sent for you., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into, True
this same whoreson apoplexy., True
Lord Chief-Justice Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with, True
you., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,, True
an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the, True
blood, a whoreson tingling., True
Lord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it? be it as it is., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
It hath its original from much grief, from study and, True
perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of, True
his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness., True
Lord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease; for you, True
hear not what I say to you., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please, True
you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady, True
of not marking, that I am troubled withal., True
Lord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the, True
attention of your ears; and I care not if I do, True
become your physician., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:, True
your lordship may minister the potion of, True
imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how, True
should I be your patient to follow your, True
prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a, True
scruple, or indeed a scruple itself., True
Lord Chief-Justice I sent for you, when there were matters against you, True
for your life, to come speak with me., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the, True
laws of this land-service, I did not come., True
Lord Chief-Justice Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less., True
Lord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender, and your waste is great., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I would it were otherwise; I would my means were, True
greater, and my waist slenderer., True
Lord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow, True
with the great belly, and he my dog., True
Lord Chief-Justice Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your, True
day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded, True
over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may, True
thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting, True
that action., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
My lord?, True
Lord Chief-Justice But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a, True
sleeping wolf., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox., True
Lord Chief-Justice What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt, True
out., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say, True
of wax, my growth would approve the truth., True
Lord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should, True
have his effect of gravity., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy., True
Lord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down, like his, True
ill angel., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope, True
he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:, True
and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I, True
cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these, True
costermonger times that true valour is turned, True
bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath, True
his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the, True
other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of, True
this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry., True
You that are old consider not the capacities of us, True
that are young; you do measure the heat of our, True
livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we, True
that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,, True
are wags too., True
Lord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,, True
that are written down old with all the characters of, True
age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a, True
yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an, True
increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your, True
wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and, True
every part about you blasted with antiquity? and, True
will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the, True
afternoon, with a white head and something a round, True
belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing, True
and singing of anthems. To approve my youth, True
further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in, True
judgment and understanding; and he that will caper, True
with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the, True
money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that, True
the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,, True
and you took it like a sensible lord. I have, True
chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;, True
marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk, True
and old sack., True
Lord Chief-Justice Well, God send the prince a better companion!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
God send the companion a better prince! I cannot, True
rid my hands of him., True
Lord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I, True
hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster, True
against the Archbishop and the Earl of, True
Northumberland., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look, True
you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,, True
that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the, True
Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean, True
not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,, True
and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I, True
might never spit white again. There is not a, True
dangerous action can peep out his head but I am, True
thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it, True
was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if, True
they have a good thing, to make it too common. If, True
ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give, True
me rest. I would to God my name were not so, True
terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be, True
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to, True
nothing with perpetual motion., True
Lord Chief-Justice Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your, True
expedition!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to, True
furnish me forth?, True
Lord Chief-Justice Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to, True
bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my, True
cousin Westmoreland., True

Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man, True
can no more separate age and covetousness than a', True
can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout, True
galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and, True
so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!, True

I can get no remedy against this consumption of the, True
purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,, True
but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter, True
to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this, True
to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old, True
Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry, True
since I perceived the first white hair on my chin., True
About it: you know where to find me., True
, True
Exit Page, True
A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for, True
the one or the other plays the rogue with my great, True
toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars, True

reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:, True

, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;, True
And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,, True
Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:, True
And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?, True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
I well allow the occasion of our arms;, True
But gladly would be better satisfied, True
How in our means we should advance ourselves, True
To look with forehead bold and big enough, True
Upon the power and puissance of the king., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
Our present musters grow upon the file, True
To five and twenty thousand men of choice;, True
And our supplies live largely in the hope, True
Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns, True
With an incensed fire of injuries., True
, True
LORD BARDOLPH, True
, True
The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;, True
Whether our present five and twenty thousand, True
May hold up head without Northumberland?, True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
With him, we may., True
, True
LORD BARDOLPH, True
, True
Yea, marry, there's the point:, True
But if without him we be thought too feeble,, True
My judgment is, we should not step too far, True
Till we had his assistance by the hand;, True
For in a theme so bloody-faced as this, True
Conjecture, expectation, and surmise, True
Of aids incertain should not be admitted., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed, True
It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury., True
, True
LORD BARDOLPH, True
, True
It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,, True
Eating the air on promise of supply,, True
Flattering himself in project of a power, True
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:, True
And so, with great imagination, True
Proper to madmen, led his powers to death, True
And winking leap'd into destruction., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt, True
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope., True
, True
LORD BARDOLPH, True
, True
Yes, if this present quality of war,, True
Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot, True
Lives so in hope as in an early spring, True
We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,, True
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair, True
That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,, True
We first survey the plot, then draw the model;, True
And when we see the figure of the house,, True
Then must we rate the cost of the erection;, True
Which if we find outweighs ability,, True
What do we then but draw anew the model, True
In fewer offices, or at last desist, True
To build at all? Much more, in this great work,, True
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down, True
And set another up, should we survey, True
The plot of situation and the model,, True
Consent upon a sure foundation,, True
Question surveyors, know our own estate,, True
How able such a work to undergo,, True
To weigh against his opposite; or else, True
We fortify in paper and in figures,, True
Using the names of men instead of men:, True
Like one that draws the model of a house, True
Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,, True

bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and, True

at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon, True
Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke, True
thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of, True
Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was, True
washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady, True
thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife, True
Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me, True
gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of, True
vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;, True
whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I, True

didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,, True
desire me to be no more so familiarity with such, True
poor people; saying that ere long they should call, True
me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me, True
fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy, True

she hath been in good case, and the truth is,, True
poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish, True
officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them., True
Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your, True
manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It, True
is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words, True
that come with such more than impudent sauciness, True
from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:, True
you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the, True
easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her, True
serve your uses both in purse and in person., True

current repentance., True

reply. You call honourable boldness impudent, True
sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say, True
nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble, True
duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say, True
to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,, True
being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs., True

Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy, True
walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of, True

not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,, True

Faith, it does me; though it discolours the, True
complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth, True
it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?, True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as, True
to remember so weak a composition., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,, True
by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,, True
small beer. But, indeed, these humble, True
considerations make me out of love with my, True
greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember, True
thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to, True
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou, True
hast, viz. these, and those that were thy, True
peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy, True
shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for, True
use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better, True
than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when, True
thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done, True
a great while, because the rest of thy low, True
countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:, True
and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins, True
of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the, True
midwives say the children are not in the fault;, True
whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are, True
mightily strengthened., True
, True
POINS, True

will tell., True

PRINCE HENRY, True

Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be, True
sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell, True
thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a, True
better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad, True
indeed too., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Very hardly upon such a subject., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's, True
book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and, True
persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell, True
thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so, True
sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art, True
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow., True

The reason?, True

What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?, True

, True
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite., True

, True
It would be every man's thought; and thou art a, True
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never, True
a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way, True
better than thine: every man would think me an, True
hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most, True
worshipful thought to think so?, True
, True
POINS, True

Why, because you have been so lewd and so much, True
engraffed to Falstaff., True

And to thee., True

POINS, True
, True
By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it, True
with my own ears: the worst that they can say of, True
me is that I am a second brother and that I am a, True

confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph., True

For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!, True
For his, it stuck upon him as the sun, True

He had no legs that practised not his gait;, True
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,, True
Became the accents of the valiant;, True

No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I, True

PRINCE HENRY, True

By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,, True
So idly to profane the precious time,, True

Exit Page, True
How many thousand of my poorest subjects, True
Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,, True
Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,, True
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down, True
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?, True
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,, True
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee, True
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,, True
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,, True
Under the canopies of costly state,, True
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?, True
O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile, True
In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch, True
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?, True
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast, True
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains, True
In cradle of the rude imperious surge, True
And in the visitation of the winds,, True
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,, True
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them, True
With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,, True
That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?, True
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose, True
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,, True
And in the calmest and most stillest night,, True
With all appliances and means to boot,, True
Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!, True

WARWICK, True
, True
We have, my liege., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom, True
How foul it is; what rank diseases grow, True
And with what danger, near the heart of it., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
It is but as a body yet distemper'd;, True
Which to his former strength may be restored, True
With good advice and little medicine:, True
My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
O God! that one might read the book of fate,, True
And see the revolution of the times, True
Make mountains level, and the continent,, True
Weary of solid firmness, melt itself, True
Into the sea! and, other times, to see, True
The beachy girdle of the ocean, True
Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,, True
And changes fill the cup of alteration, True
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,, True
The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,, True
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,, True
Would shut the book, and sit him down and die., True
'Tis not 'ten years gone, True
Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,, True
Did feast together, and in two years after, True
Were they at wars: it is but eight years since, True
This Percy was the man nearest my soul,, True
Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs, True
And laid his love and life under my foot,, True
Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard, True
Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--, True
You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--, True
, True
To WARWICK, True
When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,, True

Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?, True
'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which, True
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;', True
Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,, True
But that necessity so bow'd the state, True
That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:, True
'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,, True
'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,, True
Shall break into corruption:' so went on,, True
Foretelling this same time's condition, True
And the division of our amity., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
There is a history in all men's lives,, True
Figuring the nature of the times deceased;, True
The which observed, a man may prophesy,, True
With a near aim, of the main chance of things, True
As yet not come to life, which in their seeds, True
And weak beginnings lie intreasured., True
Such things become the hatch and brood of time;, True
And by the necessary form of this, True
King Richard might create a perfect guess, True
That great Northumberland, then false to him,, True
Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;, True
Which should not find a ground to root upon,, True
Unless on you., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
Are these things then necessities?, True
Then let us meet them like necessities:, True
And that same word even now cries out on us:, True
They say the bishop and Northumberland, True
Are fifty thousand strong., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
It cannot be, my lord;, True
Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,, True
The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace, True
To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,, True
The powers that you already have sent forth, True
Shall bring this prize in very easily., True
To comfort you the more, I have received, True
A certain instance that Glendower is dead., True
Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,, True
And these unseason'd hours perforce must add, True
Unto your sickness., True

, True
SILENCE, True
, True
Indeed, sir, to my cost., True
, True
SHALLOW, True
, True
A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was, True
once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will, True
talk of mad Shallow yet., True
, True
SILENCE, True
, True
You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin., True
, True
SHALLOW, True
, True
By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would, True
have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too., True
There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,, True
and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and, True
Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such, True
swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and, True
I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were, True
and had the best of them all at commandment. Then, True
was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to, True
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk., True
, True
SILENCE, True

This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?, True
, True
SHALLOW, True
, True
The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break, True
Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a, True
crack not thus high: and the very same day did I, True
fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,, True
behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I, True
have spent! and to see how many of my old, True
acquaintance are dead!, True

We shall all follow, cousin., True

Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,, True

Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living, True

SILENCE, True

Dead, sir., True
, True
SHALLOW, True
, True
Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a', True
shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and, True
betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have, True
clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried, True
you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a, True
half, that it would have done a man's heart good to, True
see. How a score of ewes now?, True

a most gallant leader., True

He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword, True
man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my, True
lady his wife doth?, True
, True
BARDOLPH, True
, True
Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than, True
with a wife., True
, True
SHALLOW, True
, True
It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said, True
indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,, True
indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever, True
were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of, True
'accommodo' very good; a good phrase., True
, True
BARDOLPH, True
, True
Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call, True
you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;, True
but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a, True
soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good, True
command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a, True
man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,, True
being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;, True
which is an excellent thing., True
, True
SHALLOW, True

It is very just., True

FALSTAFF, True

Prick him., True
, True
MOULDY, True
, True
I was pricked well enough before, an you could have, True
let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for, True
one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need, True
not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter, True
to go out than I., True

FALSTAFF, True

Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is, True
time you were spent., True

SHADOW, True
, True
My mother's son, sir., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's, True
shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of, True
the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the, True
father's substance!, True
, True
SHALLOW, True

Do you like him, Sir John?, True

Thou art a very ragged wart., True

It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon, True
his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:, True
prick him no more., True

You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld, True
ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in, True
an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?, True

I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more., True

wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the, True

, True
I would Wart might have gone, sir., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst, True
mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him, True
to a private soldier that is the leader of so many, True
thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble., True

It shall suffice, sir., True

for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be, True
hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,, True
I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,, True

Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a, True
man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,, True
bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the, True
spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a, True
ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and, True
discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's, True
hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets, True
on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced, True
fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no, True
mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim, True
level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;, True
how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run, True
off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the, True
great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph., True

little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i', True

tester for thee., True

SHALLOW, True

He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it, True
right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at, True
Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's, True
show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a', True
would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about, True
and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,, True
tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and, True
away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I, True
shall ne'er see such a fellow., True

These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God, True
keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words, True

On, Bardolph; lead the men away., True

Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, & c, True
As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do, True
see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how, True
subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This, True
same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to, True
me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he, True
hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third, True
word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's, True
tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a, True
man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a', True
was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked, True
radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it, True
with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his, True
dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a', True
was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a, True
monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came, True
ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those, True
tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the, True
carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or, True
his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger, True
become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a, True
Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and, True
I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the, True
Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding, True
among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a, True
Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have, True
thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the, True
case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a, True
court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll, True
be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall, True
go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two, True
stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the, True
old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I, True
may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end., True

Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth, True
To know the numbers of our enemies., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
We have sent forth already., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
'Tis well done., True
My friends and brethren in these great affairs,, True
I must acquaint you that I have received, True
New-dated letters from Northumberland;, True
Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:, True
Here doth he wish his person, with such powers, True
As might hold sortance with his quality,, True
The which he could not levy; whereupon, True
He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,, True
To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers, True
That your attempts may overlive the hazard, True
And fearful melting of their opposite., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground, True
And dash themselves to pieces., True
, True
Enter a Messenger, True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
Now, what news?, True
, True
Messenger, True
, True
West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,, True
In goodly form comes on the enemy;, True
And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number, True
Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
The just proportion that we gave them out, True
Let us sway on and face them in the field., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
What well-appointed leader fronts us here?, True
, True
Enter WESTMORELAND, True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
Health and fair greeting from our general,, True
The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:, True
What doth concern your coming?, True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
Then, my lord,, True
Unto your grace do I in chief address, True
The substance of my speech. If that rebellion, True
Came like itself, in base and abject routs,, True
Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,, True
And countenanced by boys and beggary,, True
I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,, True
In his true, native and most proper shape,, True
You, reverend father, and these noble lords, True
Had not been here, to dress the ugly form, True
Of base and bloody insurrection, True
With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,, True
Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,, True
Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,, True
Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,, True
Whose white investments figure innocence,, True
The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,, True
Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself, True
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,, True
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;, True
Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,, True
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine, True
To a trumpet and a point of war?, True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
Wherefore do I this? so the question stands., True
Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,, True
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours, True
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,, True
And we must bleed for it; of which disease, True
Our late king, Richard, being infected, died., True
But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,, True
I take not on me here as a physician,, True
Nor do I as an enemy to peace, True
Troop in the throngs of military men;, True
But rather show awhile like fearful war,, True
To diet rank minds sick of happiness, True
And purge the obstructions which begin to stop, True
Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly., True
I have in equal balance justly weigh'd, True
What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,, True
And find our griefs heavier than our offences., True
We see which way the stream of time doth run,, True
And are enforced from our most quiet there, True
By the rough torrent of occasion;, True
And have the summary of all our griefs,, True
When time shall serve, to show in articles;, True
Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,, True
And might by no suit gain our audience:, True
When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,, True
We are denied access unto his person, True
Even by those men that most have done us wrong., True
The dangers of the days but newly gone,, True
Whose memory is written on the earth, True
With yet appearing blood, and the examples, True
Of every minute's instance, present now,, True
Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,, True
Not to break peace or any branch of it,, True
But to establish here a peace indeed,, True
Concurring both in name and quality., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
When ever yet was your appeal denied?, True
Wherein have you been galled by the king?, True
What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,, True
That you should seal this lawless bloody book, True
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine, True
And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?, True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
My brother general, the commonwealth,, True
To brother born an household cruelty,, True
I make my quarrel in particular., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
There is no need of any such redress;, True
Or if there were, it not belongs to you., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
Why not to him in part, and to us all, True
That feel the bruises of the days before,, True
And suffer the condition of these times, True
To lay a heavy and unequal hand, True
Upon our honours?, True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
O, my good Lord Mowbray,, True
Construe the times to their necessities,, True
And you shall say indeed, it is the time,, True
And not the king, that doth you injuries., True
Yet for your part, it not appears to me, True
Either from the king or in the present time, True
That you should have an inch of any ground, True
To build a grief on: were you not restored, True
To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,, True
Your noble and right well remember'd father's?, True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
What thing, in honour, had my father lost,, True
That need to be revived and breathed in me?, True
The king that loved him, as the state stood then,, True
Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:, True
And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,, True
Being mounted and both roused in their seats,, True
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,, True
Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,, True
Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel, True
And the loud trumpet blowing them together,, True
Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd, True
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,, True
O when the king did throw his warder down,, True
His own life hung upon the staff he threw;, True
Then threw he down himself and all their lives, True
That by indictment and by dint of sword, True
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what., True
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then, True
In England the most valiant gentlemen:, True
Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?, True
But if your father had been victor there,, True
He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:, True
For all the country in a general voice, True
Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love, True
Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on, True
And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king., True
But this is mere digression from my purpose., True
Here come I from our princely general, True
To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace, True
That he will give you audience; and wherein, True
It shall appear that your demands are just,, True
You shall enjoy them, every thing set off, True
That might so much as think you enemies., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
But he hath forced us to compel this offer;, True
And it proceeds from policy, not love., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
Mowbray, you overween to take it so;, True
This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:, True
For, lo! within a ken our army lies,, True
Upon mine honour, all too confident, True
To give admittance to a thought of fear., True
Our battle is more full of names than yours,, True
Our men more perfect in the use of arms,, True
Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;, True
Then reason will our heart should be as good, True
Say you not then our offer is compell'd., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
Well, by my will we shall admit no parley., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
That argues but the shame of your offence:, True
A rotten case abides no handling., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
Hath the Prince John a full commission,, True
In very ample virtue of his father,, True
To hear and absolutely to determine, True
Of what conditions we shall stand upon?, True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
That is intended in the general's name:, True
I muse you make so slight a question., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,, True
For this contains our general grievances:, True
Each several article herein redress'd,, True
All members of our cause, both here and hence,, True
That are insinew'd to this action,, True
Acquitted by a true substantial form, True
And present execution of our wills, True
To us and to our purposes confined,, True
We come within our awful banks again, True
And knit our powers to the arm of peace., True
, True
WESTMORELAND, True
, True
This will I show the general. Please you, lords,, True
In sight of both our battles we may meet;, True
And either end in peace, which God so frame!, True
Or to the place of difference call the swords, True
Which must decide it., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
My lord, we will do so., True
, True
Exit WESTMORELAND, True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
There is a thing within my bosom tells me, True
That no conditions of our peace can stand., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
Fear you not that: if we can make our peace, True
Upon such large terms and so absolute, True
As our conditions shall consist upon,, True
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
Yea, but our valuation shall be such, True
That every slight and false-derived cause,, True
Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason, True
Shall to the king taste of this action;, True
That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,, True
We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind, True
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff, True
And good from bad find no partition., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary, True
Of dainty and such picking grievances:, True
For he hath found to end one doubt by death, True
Revives two greater in the heirs of life,, True
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean, True
And keep no tell-tale to his memory, True
That may repeat and history his loss, True
To new remembrance; for full well he knows, True
He cannot so precisely weed this land, True
As his misdoubts present occasion:, True
His foes are so enrooted with his friends, True
That, plucking to unfix an enemy,, True
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:, True
So that this land, like an offensive wife, True
That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,, True
As he is striking, holds his infant up, True
And hangs resolved correction in the arm, True
That was uprear'd to execution., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods, True
On late offenders, that he now doth lack, True
The very instruments of chastisement:, True
So that his power, like to a fangless lion,, True
May offer, but not hold., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
'Tis very true:, True
And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,, True
If we do now make our atonement well,, True
Our peace will, like a broken limb united,, True
Grow stronger for the breaking., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True

LANCASTER, True
, True
You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:, True
Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;, True
And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all., True
My Lord of York, it better show'd with you, True
When that your flock, assembled by the bell,, True
Encircled you to hear with reverence, True
Your exposition on the holy text, True
Than now to see you here an iron man,, True
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,, True
Turning the word to sword and life to death., True
That man that sits within a monarch's heart,, True
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,, True
Would he abuse the countenance of the king,, True
Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch, True
In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,, True
It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken, True
How deep you were within the books of God?, True
To us the speaker in his parliament;, True
To us the imagined voice of God himself;, True
The very opener and intelligencer, True
Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven, True
And our dull workings. O, who shall believe, True
But you misuse the reverence of your place,, True
Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,, True
As a false favourite doth his prince's name,, True
In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,, True
Under the counterfeited zeal of God,, True
The subjects of his substitute, my father,, True
And both against the peace of heaven and him, True
Have here up-swarm'd them., True
, True
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, True
, True
Good my Lord of Lancaster,, True
I am not here against your father's peace;, True
But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,, True
The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,, True
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,, True
To hold our safety up. I sent your grace, True
The parcels and particulars of our grief,, True
The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,, True
Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;, True
Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep, True
With grant of our most just and right desires,, True
And true obedience, of this madness cured,, True
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty., True
, True
MOWBRAY, True
, True
If not, we ready are to try our fortunes, True
To the last man., True
, True
HASTINGS, True
, True
And though we here fall down,, True
We have supplies to second our attempt:, True
If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;, True
And so success of mischief shall be born, True
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up, True
Whiles England shall have generation., True

Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your, True
degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be, True
still your name, a traitor your degree, and the, True
dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall, True
you be still Colevile of the dale., True

Are not you Sir John Falstaff?, True

As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye, True
yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do, True
sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they, True
weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and, True
trembling, and do observance to my mercy., True

I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that, True
thought yield me., True

I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of, True
mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other, True

One time or other break some gallows' back., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I, True
never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward, True
of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a, True
bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the, True
expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with, True
the very extremest inch of possibility; I have, True
foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,, True
travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and, True
immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the, True
dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy., True
But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I, True
may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,, True
'I came, saw, and overcame.', True

rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will, True
have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own, True
picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:, True
to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not, True
all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the, True
clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full, True
moon doth the cinders of the element, which show, True
like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of, True
the noble: therefore let me have right, and let, True

Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,, True
Shall better speak of you than you deserve., True

FALSTAFF, True
, True
I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than, True
your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-, True
blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make, True
him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine., True
There's never none of these demure boys come to any, True
proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,, True
and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a, True
kind of male green-sickness; and then when they, True
marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools, True
and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for, True
inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold, True
operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;, True
dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy, True
vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,, True
quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and, True
delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the, True
voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes, True
excellent wit. The second property of your, True
excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;, True
which, before cold and settled, left the liver, True
white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity, True
and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes, True
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:, True
it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives, True
warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,, True
man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and, True
inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,, True
the heart, who, great and puffed up with this, True
retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour, True
comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is, True
nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and, True
learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till, True
sack commences it and sets it in act and use., True
Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for, True
the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his, True
father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,, True
manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent, True
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile, True
sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If, True
I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I, True
would teach them should be, to forswear thin, True
potations and to addict themselves to sack., True

Thou hast a better place in his affection, True
Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,, True
And noble offices thou mayst effect, True
Of mediation, after I am dead,, True
Between his greatness and thy other brethren:, True
Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,, True
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace, True
By seeming cold or careless of his will;, True
For he is gracious, if he be observed:, True
He hath a tear for pity and a hand, True
Open as day for melting charity:, True
Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,, True
As humorous as winter and as sudden, True
As flaws congealed in the spring of day., True
His temper, therefore, must be well observed:, True
Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,, True
When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;, True
But, being moody, give him line and scope,, True
Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,, True
Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,, True
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,, True
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,, True
That the united vessel of their blood,, True

As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--, True

The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape, True
In forms imaginary the unguided days, True
And rotten times that you shall look upon, True
When I am sleeping with my ancestors., True
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,, True

That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours, True
Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!, True
Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee., True
Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity, True
Is held from falling with so weak a wind, True
That it will quickly drop: my day is dim., True
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours, True
Were thine without offence; and at my death, True
Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:, True
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,, True
And thou wilt have me die assured of it., True
Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,, True
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,, True
To stab at half an hour of my life., True
What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?, True
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,, True
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear, True

Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:, True
Only compound me with forgotten dust, True
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms., True

From every region, apes of idleness!, True
Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:, True

O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,, True
The moist impediments unto my speech,, True
I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke, True
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard, True
The course of it so far. There is your crown;, True
And He that wears the crown immortally, True
Long guard it yours! If I affect it more, True
Than as your honour and as your renown,, True
Let me no more from this obedience rise,, True
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit, True
Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending., True
God witness with me, when I here came in,, True
And found no course of breath within your majesty,, True
How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,, True
O, let me in my present wildness die, True
And never live to show the incredulous world, True
The noble change that I have purposed!, True
Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,, True
And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,, True
I spake unto this crown as having sense,, True
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending, True
Hath fed upon the body of my father;, True
Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:, True
Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,, True
Preserving life in medicine potable;, True
But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,, True
Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,, True
Accusing it, I put it on my head,, True
To try with it, as with an enemy, True
That had before my face murder'd my father,, True
The quarrel of a true inheritor., True
But if it did infect my blood with joy,, True
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;, True
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine, True
Did with the least affection of a welcome, True
Give entertainment to the might of it,, True
Let God for ever keep it from my head, True
And make me as the poorest vassal is, True
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!, True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
O my son,, True
God put it in thy mind to take it hence,, True
That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,, True
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!, True
Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;, True
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel, True
That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,, True
By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways, True
I met this crown; and I myself know well, True
How troublesome it sat upon my head., True
To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,, True
Better opinion, better confirmation;, True
For all the soil of the achievement goes, True
With me into the earth. It seem'd in me, True
But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,, True
And I had many living to upbraid, True
My gain of it by their assistances;, True
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,, True
Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears, True
Thou see'st with peril I have answered;, True
For all my reign hath been but as a scene, True
Acting that argument: and now my death, True
Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,, True
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;, True
So thou the garland wear'st successively., True
Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,, True
Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;, True
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,, True
Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;, True
By whose fell working I was first advanced, True
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear, True
To be again displaced: which to avoid,, True
I cut them off; and had a purpose now, True
To lead out many to the Holy Land,, True
Lest rest and lying still might make them look, True
Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,, True
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds, True
With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,, True
May waste the memory of the former days., True
More would I, but my lungs are wasted so, True
That strength of speech is utterly denied me., True
How I came by the crown, O God forgive;, True
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!, True

I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but, True

countenance at his friend's request. An honest, True
man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave, True
is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,, True
this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in, True
a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I, True

Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the, True
semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:, True
they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like, True
foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is, True
turned into a justice-like serving-man: their, True
spirits are so married in conjunction with the, True
participation of society that they flock together in, True
consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit, True
to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the, True
imputation of being near their master: if to his, True
men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man, True
could better command his servants. It is certain, True
that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is, True
caught, as men take diseases, one of another:, True
therefore let men take heed of their company. I, True
will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to, True
keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing, True
out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two, True
actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,, True
it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest, True

Whereon, as an offender to your father,, True
I gave bold way to my authority, True

To have a son set your decrees at nought,, True

First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech., True
My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;, True

to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I, True
should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring., True
But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it, True
known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here, True
in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your, True
patience for it and to promise you a better. I, True
meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an, True
ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and, True
you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you, True
I would be and here I commit my body to your, True
mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,, True
as most debtors do, promise you infinitely., True
If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will, True
you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but, True
light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a, True
good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,, True
and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have, True
forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the, True
gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which, True
was never seen before in such an assembly., True
One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too, True
much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will, True
continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make, True
you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for, True
any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,, True
unless already a' be killed with your hard, True
opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is, True
not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are, True
too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down, True
before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen., True

What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the, True
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes, True
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the, True
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself, True
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no, True
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand, True
the time of the day., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take, True
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not, True
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,, True
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God, True
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace, True
thou wilt have none,--, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
What, none?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to, True
prologue to an egg and butter., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not, True
us that are squires of the night's body be called, True
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's, True
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the, True
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,, True
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and, True
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the, True
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and, True
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,, True
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold, True
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most, True
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with, True
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;', True
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, True
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my, True
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And, True
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and, True
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a, True
buff jerkin?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a, True
time and oft., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;, True
and where it would not, I have used my credit., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent, True
that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet, True
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when, True
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is, True
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do, True
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
No; thou shalt., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have, True
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my, True
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell, True
you., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
For obtaining of suits?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman, True
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy, True
as a gib cat or a lugged bear., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of, True
Moor-ditch?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed, True
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young, True
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more, True
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a, True
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old, True
lord of the council rated me the other day in the, True
street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet, True
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and, True
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the, True
streets, and no man regards it., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able, True
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon, True
me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew, True
thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man, True
should speak truly, little better than one of the, True
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give, True
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:, True
I'll be damned for never a king's son in, True
Christendom., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I, True
do not, call me villain and baffle me., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying, True
to purse-taking., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a, True
man to labour in his vocation., True
, True
Enter POINS, True
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a, True
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what, True
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the, True
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to, True
a true man., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Good morrow, Ned., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?, True
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how, True
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou, True
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira, True
and a cold capon's leg?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have, True
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of, True
proverbs: he will give the devil his due., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four, True
o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going, True
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders, True
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards, True
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:, True
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke, True
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it, True
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff, True
your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry, True
at home and be hanged., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,, True
I'll hang you for going., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
You will, chops?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Hal, wilt thou make one?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good, True
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood, True
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Why, that's well said., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
I care not., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:, True
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure, True
that he shall go., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him, True
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may, True
move and what he hears may be believed, that the, True
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false, True
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want, True
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!, True
, True
Exit Falstaff, True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us, True
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot, True
manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill, True
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:, True
yourself and I will not be there; and when they, True
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut, True
this head off from my shoulders., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
How shall we part with them in setting forth?, True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Why, we will set forth before or after them, and, True
appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at, True
our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure, True
upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have, True
no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our, True
horses, by our habits and by every other, True
appointment, to be ourselves., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them, True
in the wood; our vizards we will change after we, True
leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram, True
for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as, True
true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the, True
third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll, True
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the, True
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will, True
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at, True
least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what, True
extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this, True
lies the jest., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things, True
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;, True
there I'll sup. Farewell., True
, True
POINS, True
, True
Farewell, my lord., True
, True
Exit Poins, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
I know you all, and will awhile uphold, True
The unyoked humour of your idleness:, True
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,, True
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds, True
To smother up his beauty from the world,, True
That, when he please again to be himself,, True
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,, True
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists, True
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him., True
If all the year were playing holidays,, True
To sport would be as tedious as to work;, True
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,, True
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents., True
So, when this loose behavior I throw off, True
And pay the debt I never promised,, True
By how much better than my word I am,, True
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;, True
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,, True
My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,, True
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes, True
Than that which hath no foil to set it off., True
I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;, True
Redeeming time when men think least I will., True
, True
Exit, True

SCENE III. London. The palace., True
, True
Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others, True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,, True
Unapt to stir at these indignities,, True
And you have found me; for accordingly, True
You tread upon my patience: but be sure, True
I will from henceforth rather be myself,, True
Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;, True
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,, True
And therefore lost that title of respect, True
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves, True
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;, True
And that same greatness too which our own hands, True
Have holp to make so portly., True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
My lord.--, True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see, True
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:, True
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,, True
And majesty might never yet endure, True
The moody frontier of a servant brow., True
You have good leave to leave us: when we need, True
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you., True
, True
Exit Worcester, True
You were about to speak., True
, True
To North, True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
Yea, my good lord., True
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,, True
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,, True
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied, True
As is deliver'd to your majesty:, True
Either envy, therefore, or misprison, True
Is guilty of this fault and not my son., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
My liege, I did deny no prisoners., True
But I remember, when the fight was done,, True
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,, True
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,, True
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,, True
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd, True
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;, True
He was perfumed like a milliner;, True
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held, True
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon, True
He gave his nose and took't away again;, True
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,, True
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,, True
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,, True
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,, True
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse, True
Betwixt the wind and his nobility., True
With many holiday and lady terms, True
He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded, True
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf., True
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,, True
To be so pester'd with a popinjay,, True
Out of my grief and my impatience,, True
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,, True
He should or he should not; for he made me mad, True
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet, True
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman, True
Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--, True
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth, True
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;, True
And that it was great pity, so it was,, True
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd, True
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,, True
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd, True
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,, True
He would himself have been a soldier., True
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,, True
I answer'd indirectly, as I said;, True
And I beseech you, let not his report, True
Come current for an accusation, True
Betwixt my love and your high majesty., True
, True
SIR WALTER BLUNT, True
, True
The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,, True
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said, True
To such a person and in such a place,, True
At such a time, with all the rest retold,, True
May reasonably die and never rise, True
To do him wrong or any way impeach, True
What then he said, so he unsay it now., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,, True
But with proviso and exception,, True
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight, True
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;, True
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd, True
The lives of those that he did lead to fight, True
Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,, True
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March, True
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,, True
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?, True
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,, True
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?, True
No, on the barren mountains let him starve;, True
For I shall never hold that man my friend, True
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost, True
To ransom home revolted Mortimer., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Revolted Mortimer!, True
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,, True
But by the chance of war; to prove that true, True
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,, True
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took, True
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,, True
In single opposition, hand to hand,, True
He did confound the best part of an hour, True
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:, True
Three times they breathed and three times did, True
they drink,, True
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;, True
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,, True
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,, True
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,, True
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants., True
Never did base and rotten policy, True
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;, True
Nor could the noble Mortimer, True
Receive so many, and all willingly:, True
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;, True
He never did encounter with Glendower:, True
I tell thee,, True
He durst as well have met the devil alone, True
As Owen Glendower for an enemy., True
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth, True
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:, True
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,, True
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me, True
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,, True
We licence your departure with your son., True
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it., True
, True
Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train, True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
An if the devil come and roar for them,, True
I will not send them: I will after straight, True
And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,, True
Albeit I make a hazard of my head., True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:, True
Here comes your uncle., True
, True
Re-enter WORCESTER, True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Speak of Mortimer!, True
'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul, True
Want mercy, if I do not join with him:, True
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,, True
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,, True
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer, True
As high in the air as this unthankful king,, True
As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke., True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?, True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;, True
And when I urged the ransom once again, True
Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,, True
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,, True
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd, True
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?, True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
He was; I heard the proclamation:, True
And then it was when the unhappy king,, True
--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth, True
Upon his Irish expedition;, True
From whence he intercepted did return, True
To be deposed and shortly murdered., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth, True
Live scandalized and foully spoken of., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then, True
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer, True
Heir to the crown?, True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
He did; myself did hear it., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,, True
That wished him on the barren mountains starve., True
But shall it be that you, that set the crown, True
Upon the head of this forgetful man, True
And for his sake wear the detested blot, True
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,, True
That you a world of curses undergo,, True
Being the agents, or base second means,, True
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?, True
O, pardon me that I descend so low,, True
To show the line and the predicament, True
Wherein you range under this subtle king;, True
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,, True
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,, True
That men of your nobility and power, True
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,, True
As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,, True
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,, True
An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?, True
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,, True
That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off, True
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?, True
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem, True
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves, True
Into the good thoughts of the world again,, True
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt, True
Of this proud king, who studies day and night, True
To answer all the debt he owes to you, True
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:, True
Therefore, I say--, True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Peace, cousin, say no more:, True
And now I will unclasp a secret book,, True
And to your quick-conceiving discontents, True
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,, True
As full of peril and adventurous spirit, True
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud, True
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:, True
Send danger from the east unto the west,, True
So honour cross it from the north to south,, True
And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs, True
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!, True
, True
NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
Imagination of some great exploit, True
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,, True
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,, True
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,, True
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,, True
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;, True
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear, True
Without corrival, all her dignities:, True
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!, True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
He apprehends a world of figures here,, True
But not the form of what he should attend., True
Good cousin, give me audience for a while., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
I cry you mercy., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Those same noble Scots, True
That are your prisoners,--, True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
I'll keep them all;, True
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;, True
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:, True
I'll keep them, by this hand., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
You start away, True
And lend no ear unto my purposes., True
Those prisoners you shall keep., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Nay, I will; that's flat:, True
He said he would not ransom Mortimer;, True
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;, True
But I will find him when he lies asleep,, True
And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!', True
Nay,, True
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak, True

Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that, True
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the, True
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with, True
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his, True
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one, True
that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what., True
They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;, True
they will away presently., True

as truly as a man of falsehood may., True

GADSHILL, True

What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,, True
I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old, True
Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no, True
starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou, True
dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are, True
content to do the profession some grace; that would,, True
if matters should be looked into, for their own, True
credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no, True
foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,, True
none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;, True
but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and, True
great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will, True
strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than, True
drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,, True
I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the, True
commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey, True
on her, for they ride up and down on her and make, True
her their boots., True

What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold, True
out water in foul way?, True

not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier, True
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt, True
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I, True
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have, True
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and, True
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the, True
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me, True
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it, True
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!, True

PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four, True
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very, True
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother, True
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by, True
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis., True
They take it already upon their salvation, that, True
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king, True
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,, True
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a, True
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I, True
am king of England, I shall command all the good, True
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing, True
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they, True
cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I, True
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,, True
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language, True
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost, True
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet, True
action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of, True
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped, True
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that, True
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight, True
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with, True
this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint, True
of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to, True
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,, True
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my, True
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do, True
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale, True
to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and, True
I'll show thee a precedent., True

That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a, True

upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of, True
a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the, True
Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or, True
seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his, True
hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet, True
life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,, True
'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan, True
horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some, True
fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I, True
prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and, True
that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his, True
wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow., True

You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is, True
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:, True
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime, True
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;, True
die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be, True
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a, True
shotten herring. There live not three good men, True
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and, True
grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say., True

I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a, True
dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by, True
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the, True
doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut, True
through and through; my sword hacked like a, True
hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since, True
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all, True
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or, True
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness., True

Speak, sirs; how was it?, True

Pray God you have not murdered some of them., True

Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two, True
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues, True
in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell, True
thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou, True
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my, True
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--, True

points in my target, thus., True

FALSTAFF, True

knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive, True
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst, True
not see thy hand., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True

These lies are like their father that begets them;, True
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou, True

What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the, True
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would, True
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on, True
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as, True
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon, True
compulsion, I., True

We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and, True
were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain, True
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you, True
four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your, True
prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in, True
the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts, True
away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared, True
for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard, True
bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword, True
as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!, True

thou now find out to hide thee from this open and, True

Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the, True
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?, True
why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but, True
beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true, True
prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a, True
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of, True
myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant, True
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,, True
lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap, True

O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Yes, Jack, upon instinct., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,, True
and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:, True
Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's, True
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy, True
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and, True
this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads, True
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we, True
shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,, True
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being, True
heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three, True
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that, True
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou, True
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at, True
it?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou, True
comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the, True
particulars of my life., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,, True
this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden, True
sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich, True
crown for a pitiful bald crown!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,, True
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to, True
make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have, True
wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it, True
in King Cambyses' vein., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Well, here is my leg., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True

And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility., True

O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True

Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain., True

Hostess, True
, True
O, the father, how he holds his countenance!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True

For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;, True
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes., True

O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry, True
players as ever I see!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain., True
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy, True
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though, True
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster, True
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the, True
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have, True
partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,, True
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a, True
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant, True
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;, True
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall, True
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat, True
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall, True
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a, True
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,, True
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to, True
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,, True
as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth, True
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not, True
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in, True
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in, True
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I, True
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
What manner of man, an it like your majesty?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a, True
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble, True
carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,, True
by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I, True
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man, True
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,, True
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be, True
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,, True
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that, True
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell, True
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast, True
thou been this month?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,, True
and I'll play my father., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so, True
majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by, True
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare., True

'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle, True
ye for a young prince, i' faith., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look, True
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:, True
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an, True
old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why, True
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that, True
bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel, True
of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed, True
cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with, True
the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that, True
grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in, True
years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and, True
drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a, True
capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?, True
wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,, True
but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
I would your grace would take me with you: whom, True
means your grace?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True

, True
My lord, the man I know., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
I know thou dost., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,, True
were to say more than I know. That he is old, the, True
more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but, True
that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,, True
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,, True
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a, True
sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if, True
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine, True
are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,, True
banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack, True
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,, True
valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,, True
being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him, True
thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's, True
company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world., True

I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,, True
so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart, True
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!, True
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another., True

Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up, True
above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good, True
conscience., True

Sheriff, True

One of them is well known, my gracious lord,, True
A gross fat man., True

Carrier, True
, True
As fat as butter., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
The man, I do assure you, is not here;, True
For I myself at this time have employ'd him., True
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee, True
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,, True
Send him to answer thee, or any man,, True
For any thing he shall be charged withal:, True
And so let me entreat you leave the house., True

Sheriff, True

I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen, True

O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to, True
this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,, True
keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there, True
let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the, True
morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place, True
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a, True
charge of foot; and I know his death will be a, True

ACT III, True
SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house., True
, True
Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
These promises are fair, the parties sure,, True
And our induction full of prosperous hope., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,, True
Will you sit down?, True
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!, True
I have forgot the map., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
No, here it is., True
Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,, True
For by that name as oft as Lancaster, True
Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with, True
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
I cannot blame him: at my nativity, True
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,, True
Of burning cressets; and at my birth, True
The frame and huge foundation of the earth, True
Shaked like a coward., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Why, so it would have done at the same season, if, True
your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself, True
had never been born., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
I say the earth did shake when I was born., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
And I say the earth was not of my mind,, True
If you suppose as fearing you it shook., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,, True
And not in fear of your nativity., True
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth, True
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth, True
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd, True
By the imprisoning of unruly wind, True
Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,, True
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down, True
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth, True
Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,, True
In passion shook., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Cousin, of many men, True
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave, True
To tell you once again that at my birth, True
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,, True
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds, True
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields., True
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;, True
And all the courses of my life do show, True
I am not in the roll of common men., True
Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea, True
That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,, True
Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?, True
And bring him out that is but woman's son, True
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art, True
And hold me pace in deep experiments., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh., True
I'll to dinner., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
I can call spirits from the vasty deep., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Why, so can I, or so can any man;, True
But will they come when you do call for them?, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command, True
The devil., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil, True
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil., True
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,, True
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence., True
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head, True
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye, True
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him, True
Bootless home and weather-beaten back., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Home without boots, and in foul weather too!, True
How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right, True
According to our threefold order ta'en?, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
The archdeacon hath divided it, True
Into three limits very equally:, True
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,, True
By south and east is to my part assign'd:, True
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,, True
And all the fertile land within that bound,, True
To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you, True
The remnant northward, lying off from Trent., True
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;, True
Which being sealed interchangeably,, True
A business that this night may execute,, True
To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I, True
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth, True
To meet your father and the Scottish power,, True
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury., True
My father Glendower is not ready yet,, True
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days., True
Within that space you may have drawn together, True
Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:, True
And in my conduct shall your ladies come;, True
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,, True
For there will be a world of water shed, True
Upon the parting of your wives and you., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,, True
In quantity equals not one of yours:, True
See how this river comes me cranking in,, True
And cuts me from the best of all my land, True
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out., True
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;, True
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run, True
In a new channel, fair and evenly;, True
It shall not wind with such a deep indent,, True
To rob me of so rich a bottom here., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Yea, but, True
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up, True
With like advantage on the other side;, True
Gelding the opposed continent as much, True
As on the other side it takes from you., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here, True
And on this north side win this cape of land;, True
And then he runs straight and even., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
I'll have it so: a little charge will do it., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
I'll not have it alter'd., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Will not you?, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
No, nor you shall not., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Who shall say me nay?, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Why, that will I., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
I can speak English, lord, as well as you;, True
For I was train'd up in the English court;, True
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp, True
Many an English ditty lovely well, True
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,, True
A virtue that was never seen in you., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Marry,, True
And I am glad of it with all my heart:, True
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew, True
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;, True
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,, True
Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;, True
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,, True
Nothing so much as mincing poetry:, True
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Come, you shall have Trent turn'd., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land, True
To any well-deserving friend;, True
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,, True
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair., True
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
The moon shines fair; you may away by night:, True
I'll haste the writer and withal, True
Break with your wives of your departure hence:, True
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,, True
So much she doteth on her Mortimer., True
, True
Exit GLENDOWER, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!, True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
I cannot choose: sometime he angers me, True
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,, True
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,, True
And of a dragon and a finless fish,, True
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,, True
A couching lion and a ramping cat,, True
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff, True
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;, True
He held me last night at least nine hours, True
In reckoning up the several devils' names, True
That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,', True
But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious, True
As a tired horse, a railing wife;, True
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live, True
With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,, True
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me, True
In any summer-house in Christendom., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,, True
Exceedingly well read, and profited, True
In strange concealments, valiant as a lion, True
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful, True
As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?, True
He holds your temper in a high respect, True
And curbs himself even of his natural scope, True
When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:, True
I warrant you, that man is not alive, True
Might so have tempted him as you have done,, True
Without the taste of danger and reproof:, True
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;, True
And since your coming hither have done enough, True
To put him quite beside his patience., True
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:, True
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--, True
And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--, True
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,, True
Defect of manners, want of government,, True
Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:, True
The least of which haunting a nobleman, True
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain, True
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,, True
Beguiling them of commendation., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!, True
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave., True
, True
Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
This is the deadly spite that angers me;, True
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;, True
She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy, True
Shall follow in your conduct speedily., True
, True
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,, True
one that no persuasion can do good upon., True
, True
The lady speaks in Welsh, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh, True
Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens, True
I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,, True
In such a parley should I answer thee., True
, True
The lady speaks again in Welsh, True
I understand thy kisses and thou mine,, True
And that's a feeling disputation:, True
But I will never be a truant, love,, True
Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue, True
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,, True
Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,, True
With ravishing division, to her lute., True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad., True

The lady speaks again in Welsh, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
O, I am ignorance itself in this!, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True
, True
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down, True
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,, True
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you, True
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep., True
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,, True
Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep, True
As is the difference betwixt day and night, True
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team, True
Begins his golden progress in the east., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:, True
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn, True
, True
GLENDOWER, True

Do so;, True
And those musicians that shall play to you, True
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,, True

The music plays, True

HOTSPUR, True

Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;, True
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous., True
By'r lady, he is a good musician., True
, True
LADY PERCY, True
, True
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are, True
altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,, True
and hear the lady sing in Welsh., True

I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish., True

LADY PERCY, True

Not mine, in good sooth., True

Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a, True
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and, True
'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and, True
'as sure as day,', True
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,, True
As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury., True
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,, True
A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,', True
And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,, True
To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens., True
Come, sing., True

, True
I will not sing., True

SCENE II. London. The palace., True
, True
Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others, True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I, True
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,, True
For we shall presently have need of you., True
, True
Exeunt Lords, True
I know not whether God will have it so,, True
For some displeasing service I have done,, True
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood, True
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;, True
But thou dost in thy passages of life, True
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd, True
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven, True
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,, True
Could such inordinate and low desires,, True
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,, True
Such barren pleasures, rude society,, True
As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,, True
Accompany the greatness of thy blood, True
And hold their level with thy princely heart?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
So please your majesty, I would I could, True
Quit all offences with as clear excuse, True
As well as I am doubtless I can purge, True
Myself of many I am charged withal:, True
Yet such extenuation let me beg,, True
As, in reproof of many tales devised,, True
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,, True
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,, True
I may, for some things true, wherein my youth, True
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,, True
Find pardon on my true submission., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,, True
At thy affections, which do hold a wing, True
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors., True
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost., True
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,, True
And art almost an alien to the hearts, True
Of all the court and princes of my blood:, True
The hope and expectation of thy time, True
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man, True
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall., True
Had I so lavish of my presence been,, True
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,, True
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,, True
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,, True
Had still kept loyal to possession, True
And left me in reputeless banishment,, True
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood., True
By being seldom seen, I could not stir, True
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;, True
That men would tell their children 'This is he;', True
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?', True
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,, True
And dress'd myself in such humility, True
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,, True
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,, True
Even in the presence of the crowned king., True
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;, True
My presence, like a robe pontifical,, True
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,, True
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast, True
And won by rareness such solemnity., True
The skipping king, he ambled up and down, True
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,, True
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,, True
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,, True
Had his great name profaned with their scorns, True
And gave his countenance, against his name,, True
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push, True
Of every beardless vain comparative,, True
Grew a companion to the common streets,, True
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;, True
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,, True
They surfeited with honey and began, True
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little, True
More than a little is by much too much., True
So when he had occasion to be seen,, True
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,, True
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes, True
As, sick and blunted with community,, True
Afford no extraordinary gaze,, True
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty, True
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;, True
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,, True
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect, True
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,, True
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full., True
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;, True
For thou has lost thy princely privilege, True
With vile participation: not an eye, True
But is a-weary of thy common sight,, True
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;, True
Which now doth that I would not have it do,, True
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,, True
Be more myself., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
For all the world, True
As thou art to this hour was Richard then, True
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,, True
And even as I was then is Percy now., True
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,, True
He hath more worthy interest to the state, True
Than thou the shadow of succession;, True
For of no right, nor colour like to right,, True
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,, True
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,, True
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,, True
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on, True
To bloody battles and to bruising arms., True
What never-dying honour hath he got, True
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,, True
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms, True
Holds from all soldiers chief majority, True
And military title capital, True
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:, True
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,, True
This infant warrior, in his enterprises, True
Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,, True
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,, True
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up, True
And shake the peace and safety of our throne., True
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,, True
The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,, True
Capitulate against us and are up., True
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?, True
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,, True
Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?, True
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,, True
Base inclination and the start of spleen, True
To fight against me under Percy's pay,, True
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,, True
To show how much thou art degenerate., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Do not think so; you shall not find it so:, True
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd, True
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!, True
I will redeem all this on Percy's head, True
And in the closing of some glorious day, True
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;, True
When I will wear a garment all of blood, True
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,, True
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:, True
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,, True
That this same child of honour and renown,, True
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,, True
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet., True
For every honour sitting on his helm,, True
Would they were multitudes, and on my head, True
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,, True
That I shall make this northern youth exchange, True
His glorious deeds for my indignities., True
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,, True
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;, True
And I will call him to so strict account,, True
That he shall render every glory up,, True
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,, True
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart., True
This, in the name of God, I promise here:, True
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,, True
I do beseech your majesty may salve, True
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:, True
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;, True
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths, True
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
A hundred thousand rebels die in this:, True
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein., True

Enter BLUNT, True
How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed., True
, True
SIR WALTER BLUNT, True
, True
So hath the business that I come to speak of., True
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word, True
That Douglas and the English rebels met, True
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury, True
A mighty and a fearful head they are,, True
If promises be kept on every hand,, True
As ever offer'd foul play in the state., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;, True
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;, True
For this advertisement is five days old:, True
On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;, True
On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting, True
Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march, True
Through Gloucestershire; by which account,, True
Our business valued, some twelve days hence, True
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet., True
Our hands are full of business: let's away;, True
Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay., True

Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern., True

Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last, True
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my, True
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose, True
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,, True
I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some, True
liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I, True
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not, True
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I, True
am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a, True
church! Company, villanous company, hath been the, True
spoil of me., True
, True
BARDOLPH, True
, True
Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make, True
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman, True
need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not, True
above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once, True
in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I, True
borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in, True
good compass: and now I live out of all order, out, True
of all compass., True
, True
BARDOLPH, True
, True
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs, True
be out of all compass, out of all reasonable, True
compass, Sir John., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:, True
thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in, True
the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the, True
Knight of the Burning Lamp., True
, True
BARDOLPH, True
, True
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many, True
a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I, True
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and, True
Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his, True
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way, True
given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath, True
should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but, True
thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but, True
for the light in thy face, the son of utter, True
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the, True
night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou, True
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,, True
there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a, True
perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!, True
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and, True
torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt, True
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast, True
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap, True
at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have, True
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any, True
time this two and thirty years; God reward me for, True
it!, True

God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned., True
, True
Enter Hostess, True
How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired, True
yet who picked my pocket?, True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you, True
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,, True
I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy, True
by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair, True
was never lost in my house before., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many, True
a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go, True
to, you are a woman, go., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never, True
called so in mine own house before., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Go to, I know you well enough., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know, True
you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now, True
you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought, True
you a dozen of shirts to your back., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to, True
bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight, True
shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir, True
John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent, True
you, four and twenty pound., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
He had his part of it; let him pay., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?, True
let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:, True
Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker, True
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I, True
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a, True
seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not, True
how oft, that ring was copper!, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an, True
he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he, True
would say so., True
, True
Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life, True
How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?, True
must we all march?, True

Good my lord, hear me., True

Prithee, let her alone, and list to me., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
What sayest thou, Jack?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, True
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned, True
bawdy-house; they pick pockets., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
What didst thou lose, Jack?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of, True
forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my, True
grandfather's., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
A trifle, some eight-penny matter., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your, True
grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely, True
of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said, True
he would cudgel you., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
What! he did not?, True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed, True
prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn, True
fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the, True
deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,, True
go, True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Say, what thing? what thing?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
What thing! why, a thing to thank God on., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou, True
shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,, True
setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to, True
call me so., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say, True
otherwise., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
What beast! why, an otter., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not, True
where to have her., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any, True
man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you, True
ought him a thousand pound., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth, True
a million: thou owest me thy love., True
, True
Hostess, True
, True
Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would, True
cudgel you., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Did I, Bardolph?, True
, True
BARDOLPH, True
, True
Indeed, Sir John, you said so., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Yea, if he said my ring was copper., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:, True
but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the, True
roaring of a lion's whelp., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
And why not as the lion?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou, True
think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an, True
I do, I pray God my girdle break., True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy, True
knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,, True
truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all, True
filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest, True
woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,, True
impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in, True
thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of, True
bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of, True
sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket, True
were enriched with any other injuries but these, I, True
am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will, True
not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?, True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of, True
innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack, True
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I, True
have more flesh than another man, and therefore more, True
frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True
, True
It appears so by the story., True
, True
FALSTAFF, True
, True
Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;, True
love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy, True
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest, True
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,, True
prithee, be gone., True
, True
Exit Hostess, True
Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,, True
lad, how is that answered?, True
, True
PRINCE HENRY, True

O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to, True
thee: the money is paid back again., True

Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth, True
In this fine age were not thought flattery,, True
Such attribution should the Douglas have,, True
As not a soldier of this season's stamp, True
Should go so general current through the world., True
By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy, True

Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect, True
The very life-blood of our enterprise;, True
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp., True
He writes me here, that inward sickness--, True
And that his friends by deputation could not, True
So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet, True
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust, True
On any soul removed but on his own., True
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,, True
That with our small conjunction we should on,, True
To see how fortune is disposed to us;, True

Your father's sickness is a maim to us., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True

A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:, True

Seems more than we shall find it: were it good, True
To set the exact wealth of all our states, True
All at one cast? to set so rich a main, True
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?, True

The quality and hair of our attempt, True
Brooks no division: it will be thought, True
By some, that know not why he is away,, True
That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike, True
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:, True
And think how such an apprehension, True
May turn the tide of fearful faction, True
And breed a kind of question in our cause;, True
For well you know we of the offering side, True
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,, True
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence, True
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:, True
This absence of your father's draws a curtain,, True
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear, True
Before not dreamt of., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
You strain too far., True
I rather of his absence make this use:, True
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,, True
A larger dare to our great enterprise,, True
Than if the earl were here; for men must think,, True
If we without his help can make a head, True

Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire, True

If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused, True
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably., True
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty, True
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me, True
none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire, True
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked, True
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,, True
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as, True
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck, True
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such, True
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no, True
bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out, True
their services; and now my whole charge consists of, True
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of, True
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the, True
painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his, True
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but, True
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to, True
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers, True
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a, True
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than, True
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up, True
the rooms of them that have bought out their, True
services, that you would think that I had a hundred, True
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from, True
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad, True
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded, True
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye, True
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through, True
Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the, True
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had, True
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of, True
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my, True
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked, True
together and thrown over the shoulders like an, True
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say, True
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or, True
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all, True

Because you are not of our quality,, True
But stand against us like an enemy., True
, True
SIR WALTER BLUNT, True
, True
And God defend but still I should stand so,, True
So long as out of limit and true rule, True
You stand against anointed majesty., True
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know, True
The nature of your griefs, and whereupon, True
You conjure from the breast of civil peace, True
Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land, True
Audacious cruelty. If that the king, True
Have any way your good deserts forgot,, True
Which he confesseth to be manifold,, True
He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed, True
You shall have your desires with interest, True
And pardon absolute for yourself and these, True
Herein misled by your suggestion., True
, True
HOTSPUR, True
, True
The king is kind; and well we know the king, True
Knows at what time to promise, when to pay., True
My father and my uncle and myself, True
Did give him that same royalty he wears;, True
And when he was not six and twenty strong,, True
Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,, True
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,, True
My father gave him welcome to the shore;, True
And when he heard him swear and vow to God, True
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,, True
To sue his livery and beg his peace,, True
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,, True
My father, in kind heart and pity moved,, True
Swore him assistance and perform'd it too., True
Now when the lords and barons of the realm, True
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,, True
The more and less came in with cap and knee;, True
Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,, True
Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,, True
Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,, True
Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him, True
Even at the heels in golden multitudes., True
He presently, as greatness knows itself,, True
Steps me a little higher than his vow, True
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,, True
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;, True
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform, True
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees, True
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,, True
Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep, True
Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,, True
This seeming brow of justice, did he win, True
The hearts of all that he did angle for;, True
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads, True
Of all the favourites that the absent king, True
In deputation left behind him here,, True

In short time after, he deposed the king;, True
Soon after that, deprived him of his life;, True
And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:, True
To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,, True
Who is, if every owner were well placed,, True
Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,, True
There without ransom to lie forfeited;, True
Disgraced me in my happy victories,, True
Sought to entrap me by intelligence;, True
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;, True
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;, True
Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,, True
And in conclusion drove us to seek out, True
This head of safety; and withal to pry, True
Into his title, the which we find, True
Too indirect for long continuance., True

As I am truly given to understand,, True
The king with mighty and quick-raised power, True
Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,, True
What with the sickness of Northumberland,, True
Whose power was in the first proportion,, True
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,, True
Who with them was a rated sinew too, True
And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,, True
I fear the power of Percy is too weak, True
To wage an instant trial with the king., True

Enter WORCESTER and VERNON, True
How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well, True
That you and I should meet upon such terms, True
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,, True
And made us doff our easy robes of peace,, True
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:, True
This is not well, my lord, this is not well., True
What say you to it? will you again unknit, True
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?, True
And move in that obedient orb again, True
Where you did give a fair and natural light,, True
And be no more an exhaled meteor,, True
A prodigy of fear and a portent, True
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?, True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Hear me, my liege:, True
For mine own part, I could be well content, True

EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks, True
Of favour from myself and all our house;, True
And yet I must remember you, my lord,, True
We were the first and dearest of your friends., True
For you my staff of office did I break, True
In Richard's time; and posted day and night, True
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,, True
When yet you were in place and in account, True
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I., True
It was myself, my brother and his son,, True
That brought you home and boldly did outdare, True
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,, True
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,, True
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;, True
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,, True
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:, True
To this we swore our aid. But in short space, True
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;, True
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,, True
What with our help, what with the absent king,, True
What with the injuries of a wanton time,, True
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,, True
And the contrarious winds that held the king, True
So long in his unlucky Irish wars, True
That all in England did repute him dead:, True
And from this swarm of fair advantages, True
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd, True
To gripe the general sway into your hand;, True
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;, True
And being fed by us you used us so, True
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,, True
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;, True
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk, True
That even our love durst not come near your sight, True
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing, True
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly, True
Out of sight and raise this present head;, True
Whereby we stand opposed by such means, True
As you yourself have forged against yourself, True
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,, True
And violation of all faith and troth, True
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True
, True
These things indeed you have articulate,, True
Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,, True
To face the garment of rebellion, True
With some fine colour that may please the eye, True
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,, True
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news, True
Of hurlyburly innovation:, True
And never yet did insurrection want, True
Such water-colours to impaint his cause;, True
Nor moody beggars, starving for a time, True
Of pellmell havoc and confusion., True

In both your armies there is many a soul, True

In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,, True
This present enterprise set off his head,, True
I do not think a braver gentleman,, True
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,, True
More daring or more bold, is now alive, True
To grace this latter age with noble deeds., True
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,, True
I have a truant been to chivalry;, True
And so I hear he doth account me too;, True
Yet this before my father's majesty--, True
I am content that he shall take the odds, True
Of his great name and estimation,, True
And will, to save the blood on either side,, True
Try fortune with him in a single fight., True
, True
KING HENRY IV, True

And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,, True
Albeit considerations infinite, True
Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,, True
We love our people well; even those we love, True
That are misled upon your cousin's part;, True
And, will they take the offer of our grace,, True
Both he and they and you, every man, True
Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:, True
So tell your cousin, and bring me word, True
What he will do: but if he will not yield,, True
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us, True
And they shall do their office. So, be gone;, True
We will not now be troubled with reply:, True
We offer fair; take it advisedly., True

FALSTAFF, True

'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before, True
his day. What need I be so forward with him that, True
calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks, True
me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I, True
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or, True
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no., True
Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is, True
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what, True
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?, True
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no., True
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,, True
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?, True
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore, True
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so, True

'Twere best he did., True
, True
EARL OF WORCESTER, True
, True
Then are we all undone., True
It is not possible, it cannot be,, True
The king should keep his word in loving us;, True
He will suspect us still and find a time, True
To punish this offence in other faults:, True
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;, True
For treason is but trusted like the fox,, True
Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,, True
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors., True
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,, True
Interpretation will misquote our looks,, True
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,, True
The better cherish'd, still the nearer death., True
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;, True
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,, True
And an adopted name of privilege,, True
A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:, True
All his offences live upon my head, True
And on his father's; we did train him on,, True
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,, True
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all., True

No, by my soul; I never in my life, True
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,, True
Unless a brother should a brother dare, True
To gentle exercise and proof of arms., True
He gave you all the duties of a man;, True
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,, True
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,, True
Making you ever better than his praise, True
By still dispraising praise valued in you;, True
And, which became him like a prince indeed,, True
He made a blushing cital of himself;, True
And chid his truant youth with such a grace, True
As if he master'd there a double spirit., True
Of teaching and of learning instantly., True
There did he pause: but let me tell the world,, True
If he outlive the envy of this day,, True
England did never owe so sweet a hope,, True

lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I, True

is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the, True
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:, True
but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby, True
liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and, True
perfect image of life indeed. The better part of, True
valour is discretion; in the which better part I, True

gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he, True

You came not of one mother then, it seems., True
, True
BASTARD, True

Most certain of one mother, mighty king;, True
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:, True

I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:, True
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may., True

Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!, True
, True
KING JOHN, True

A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,, True
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?, True

I know not why, except to get the land., True
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:, True

Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--, True
Compare our faces and be judge yourself., True
If old sir Robert did beget us both, True

Do you not read some tokens of my son, True

KING JOHN, True
, True
Mine eye hath well examined his parts, True

BASTARD, True

Because he hath a half-face, like my father., True

My gracious liege, when that my father lived,, True
Your brother did employ my father much,--, True

BASTARD, True

Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:, True
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother., True
, True
ROBERT, True
, True
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy, True
To Germany, there with the emperor, True
To treat of high affairs touching that time., True
The advantage of his absence took the king, True
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;, True
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,, True
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores, True
Between my father and my mother lay,, True
As I have heard my father speak himself,, True
When this same lusty gentleman was got., True
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd, True
His lands to me, and took it on his death, True
That this my mother's son was none of his;, True
And if he were, he came into the world, True
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time., True

My father's land, as was my father's will., True
, True
KING JOHN, True

Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;, True
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,, True

Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,, True
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?, True
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept, True
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;, True
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,, True
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,, True
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;, True
My mother's son did get your father's heir;, True
Your father's heir must have your father's land., True

Shall then my father's will be of no force, True
To dispossess that child which is not his?, True

My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin, True

Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!', True
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,, True
Would I might never stir from off this place,, True
I would give it every foot to have this face;, True
I would not be sir Nob in any case., True

Well, now can I make any Joan a lady., True

And so, ere answer knows what question would,, True
Saving in dialogue of compliment,, True
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,, True
The Pyrenean and the river Po,, True
It draws toward supper in conclusion so., True

Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee., True

Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name, True
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,, True
To charge me to an answer, as the pope., True
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England, True
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest, True

With all religious strength of sacred vows;, True
The latest breath that gave the sound of words, True
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love, True
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,, True
And even before this truce, but new before,, True
No longer than we well could wash our hands, True
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,, True

And make a riot on the gentle brow, True
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,, True
My reverend father, let it not be so!, True
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose, True
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest, True
To do your pleasure and continue friends., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True

All form is formless, order orderless,, True

A mother's curse, on her revolting son., True
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,, True
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,, True
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,, True

KING PHILIP, True

CARDINAL PANDULPH, True

Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow, True
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,, True
That is, to be the champion of our church!, True
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself, True
And may not be performed by thyself,, True
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss, True
Is not amiss when it is truly done,, True
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,, True
The truth is then most done not doing it:, True
The better act of purposes mistook, True
Is to mistake again; though indirect,, True
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,, True
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire, True
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd., True
It is religion that doth make vows kept;, True
But thou hast sworn against religion,, True
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,, True
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth, True
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure, True
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;, True
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!, True
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;, True
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear., True
Therefore thy later vows against thy first, True
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;, True
And better conquest never canst thou make, True
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts, True
Against these giddy loose suggestions:, True
Upon which better part our prayers come in,, True

Yet it shall come from me to do thee good., True
I had a thing to say, but let it go:, True
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,, True
Attended with the pleasures of the world,, True
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds, True
To give me audience: if the midnight bell, True
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,, True
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;, True
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,, True
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,, True
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,, True
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,, True
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,, True
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes, True
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,, True
A passion hateful to my purposes,, True
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,, True
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply, True
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,, True
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;, True
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,, True

Death, death; O amiable lovely death!, True
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!, True
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,, True
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,, True
And I will kiss thy detestable bones, True
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows, True
And ring these fingers with thy household worms, True
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust, True
And be a carrion monster like thyself:, True
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest, True
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,, True
O, come to me!, True

O fair affliction, peace!, True

CONSTANCE, True

No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:, True
O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!, True
Then with a passion would I shake the world;, True
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy, True
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,, True
Which scorns a modern invocation., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow., True
, True
CONSTANCE, True
, True
Thou art not holy to belie me so;, True
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;, True
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;, True
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:, True
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!, True
For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:, True
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!, True
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,, True
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;, True
For being not mad but sensible of grief,, True
My reasonable part produces reason, True
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,, True
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:, True
If I were mad, I should forget my son,, True
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:, True
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel, True
The different plague of each calamity., True
, True
KING PHILIP, True
, True
Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note, True
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!, True
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,, True
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends, True
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,, True
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,, True
Sticking together in calamity., True

To England, if you will., True
, True
KING PHILIP, True

Bind up your hairs., True

Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?, True
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud, True
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,, True
As they have given these hairs their liberty!', True
But now I envy at their liberty,, True
And will again commit them to their bonds,, True
Because my poor child is a prisoner., True
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say, True
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:, True
If that be true, I shall see my boy again;, True
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,, True
To him that did but yesterday suspire,, True
There was not such a gracious creature born., True
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud, True
And chase the native beauty from his cheek, True
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,, True
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,, True
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,, True
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven, True
I shall not know him: therefore never, never, True
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True

You hold too heinous a respect of grief., True

You are as fond of grief as of your child., True

Grief fills the room up of my absent child,, True
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,, True
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,, True
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,, True
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;, True
Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?, True
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,, True
I could give better comfort than you do., True
I will not keep this form upon my head,, True
When there is such disorder in my wit., True

There's nothing in this world can make me joy:, True
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale, True
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;, True

That it yields nought but shame and bitterness., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
Before the curing of a strong disease,, True
Even in the instant of repair and health,, True
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,, True

All days of glory, joy and happiness., True

CARDINAL PANDULPH, True

If you had won it, certainly you had., True
No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,, True
She looks upon them with a threatening eye., True
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost, True

Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?, True

As heartily as he is glad he hath him., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood., True
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;, True
For even the breath of what I mean to speak, True
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,, True
Out of the path which shall directly lead, True
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark., True
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be, True
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,, True
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,, True
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest., True
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand, True
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;, True
And he that stands upon a slippery place, True
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:, True
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;, True
So be it, for it cannot be but so., True
, True
LEWIS, True
, True
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?, True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,, True
May then make all the claim that Arthur did., True
, True
LEWIS, True
, True
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
How green you are and fresh in this old world!, True
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;, True
For he that steeps his safety in true blood, True
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue., True
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts, True
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,, True
That none so small advantage shall step forth, True
To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;, True
No natural exhalation in the sky,, True
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,, True
No common wind, no customed event,, True
But they will pluck away his natural cause, True
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,, True
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,, True
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John., True
, True
LEWIS, True
, True
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,, True
But hold himself safe in his prisonment., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,, True
If that young Arthur be not gone already,, True
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts, True
Of all his people shall revolt from him, True
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change, True
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath, True
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John., True
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:, True
And, O, what better matter breeds for you, True
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge, True
Is now in England, ransacking the church,, True
Offending charity: if but a dozen French, True
Were there in arms, they would be as a call, True
To train ten thousand English to their side,, True
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,, True
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,, True
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful, True
What may be wrought out of their discontent,, True
Now that their souls are topful of offence., True
For England go: I will whet on the king., True

Indeed, I have been merrier., True
, True
ARTHUR, True
, True
Mercy on me!, True
Methinks no body should be sad but I:, True
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,, True
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,, True
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,, True
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,, True
I should be as merry as the day is long;, True
And so I would be here, but that I doubt, True
My uncle practises more harm to me:, True
He is afraid of me and I of him:, True
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?, True
No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven, True
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert., True
, True
HUBERT, True

[Aside] If I talk to him, with his innocent prate, True
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:, True

ARTHUR, True
, True
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,, True
I knit my handercher about your brows,, True
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,, True
And I did never ask it you again;, True
And with my hand at midnight held your head,, True
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,, True
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,, True
Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?', True
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?', True
Many a poor man's son would have lien still, True
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;, True
But you at your sick service had a prince., True
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love, True
And call it cunning: do, an if you will:, True
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,, True
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?, True
These eyes that never did nor never shall, True
So much as frown on you., True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
I have sworn to do it;, True
And with hot irons must I burn them out., True
, True
ARTHUR, True
, True
Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!, True
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,, True
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears, True
And quench his fiery indignation, True
Even in the matter of mine innocence;, True
Nay, after that, consume away in rust, True
But for containing fire to harm mine eye., True
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?, True
An if an angel should have come to me, True
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,, True
I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's., True

I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still., True
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!, True
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,, True
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;, True
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,, True

O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,, True
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,, True
Any annoyance in that precious sense!, True

Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues, True

So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes., True
Though to no use but still to look on you!, True
Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold, True
And would not harm me., True

I can heat it, boy., True

ARTHUR, True

No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,, True
Being create for comfort, to be used, True
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;, True
There is no malice in this burning coal;, True
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out, True
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head., True

HUBERT, True

But with my breath I can revive it, boy., True

ARTHUR, True

An if you do, you will but make it blush, True

Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;, True
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,, True
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on., True
All things that you should use to do me wrong, True
Deny their office: only you do lack, True
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,, True

And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,, True
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;, True
Fresh expectation troubled not the land, True
With any long'd-for change or better state., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,, True
To guard a title that was rich before,, True
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,, True
To throw a perfume on the violet,, True
To smooth the ice, or add another hue, True
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light, True
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,, True
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
But that your royal pleasure must be done,, True
This act is as an ancient tale new told,, True
And in the last repeating troublesome,, True
Being urged at a time unseasonable., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
In this the antique and well noted face, True
Of plain old form is much disfigured;, True
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,, True
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,, True
Startles and frights consideration,, True
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,, True
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
When workmen strive to do better than well,, True
They do confound their skill in covetousness;, True
And oftentimes excusing of a fault, True
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,, True
As patches set upon a little breach, True
Discredit more in hiding of the fault, True
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
To this effect, before you were new crown'd,, True
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness, True
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,, True
Since all and every part of what we would, True
Doth make a stand at what your highness will., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Some reasons of this double coronation, True
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;, True
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,, True
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask, True
What you would have reform'd that is not well,, True
And well shall you perceive how willingly, True
I will both hear and grant you your requests., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,, True
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,, True
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,, True
Your safety, for the which myself and them, True
Bend their best studies, heartily request, True
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint, True
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent, True
To break into this dangerous argument,--, True
If what in rest you have in right you hold,, True
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend, True
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up, True
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days, True
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth, True
The rich advantage of good exercise?, True
That the time's enemies may not have this, True
To grace occasions, let it be our suit, True
That you have bid us ask his liberty;, True
Which for our goods we do no further ask, True
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,, True
Counts it your weal he have his liberty., True
, True
Enter HUBERT, True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Let it be so: I do commit his youth, True
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?, True
, True
Taking him apart, True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
This is the man should do the bloody deed;, True
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:, True
The image of a wicked heinous fault, True
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his, True
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;, True
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,, True
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
The colour of the king doth come and go, True
Between his purpose and his conscience,, True
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:, True
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence, True
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:, True
Good lords, although my will to give is living,, True
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:, True
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
Indeed we heard how near his death he was, True
Before the child himself felt he was sick:, True
This must be answer'd either here or hence., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?, True
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?, True
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?, True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame, True
That greatness should so grossly offer it:, True
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,, True
And find the inheritance of this poor child,, True
His little kingdom of a forced grave., True
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,, True
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!, True
This must not be thus borne: this will break out, True
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt., True
, True
Exeunt Lords, True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
They burn in indignation. I repent:, True
There is no sure foundation set on blood,, True
No certain life achieved by others' death., True
, True
Enter a Messenger, True
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood, True
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?, True
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:, True
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?, True
, True
Messenger, True
, True
From France to England. Never such a power, True
For any foreign preparation, True
Was levied in the body of a land., True
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;, True
For when you should be told they do prepare,, True
The tidings come that they are all arrived., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?, True
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,, True
That such an army could be drawn in France,, True
And she not hear of it?, True
, True
Messenger, True
, True
My liege, her ear, True
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died, True
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,, True
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died, True
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue, True
I idly heard; if true or false I know not., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!, True
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased, True
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!, True
How wildly then walks my estate in France!, True
Under whose conduct came those powers of France, True
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?, True
, True
Messenger, True
, True
Under the Dauphin., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Thou hast made me giddy, True
With these ill tidings., True
, True
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret, True
Now, what says the world, True
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff, True
My head with more ill news, for it is full., True
, True
BASTARD, True
, True
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,, True
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed, True
Under the tide: but now I breathe again, True
Aloft the flood, and can give audience, True
To any tongue, speak it of what it will., True
, True
BASTARD, True
, True
How I have sped among the clergymen,, True
The sums I have collected shall express., True
But as I travell'd hither through the land,, True
I find the people strangely fantasied;, True
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,, True
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:, True
And here a prophet, that I brought with me, True
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found, True
With many hundreds treading on his heels;, True
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,, True
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,, True
Your highness should deliver up your crown., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?, True
, True
PETER, True
, True
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Hubert, away with him; imprison him;, True
And on that day at noon whereon he says, True
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd., True
Deliver him to safety; and return,, True
For I must use thee., True
, True
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER, True
O my gentle cousin,, True
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?, True
, True
BASTARD, True
, True
The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:, True
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,, True
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,, True
And others more, going to seek the grave, True
Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night, True
On your suggestion., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Gentle kinsman, go,, True
And thrust thyself into their companies:, True
I have a way to win their loves again;, True
Bring them before me., True
, True
BASTARD, True
, True
I will seek them out., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before., True
O, let me have no subject enemies,, True
When adverse foreigners affright my towns, True
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!, True
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,, True
And fly like thought from them to me again., True
, True
BASTARD, True
, True
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed., True
, True
Exit, True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman., True
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need, True
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;, True
And be thou he., True
, True
Messenger, True
, True
With all my heart, my liege., True

My mother dead!, True

Re-enter HUBERT, True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;, True
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about, True
The other four in wondrous motion., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Five moons!, True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
Old men and beldams in the streets, True
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:, True
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:, True
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads, True
And whisper one another in the ear;, True
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,, True
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,, True
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes., True
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,, True
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,, True
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;, True
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,, True
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste, True
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,, True
Told of a many thousand warlike French, True
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:, True
Another lean unwash'd artificer, True
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?, True
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?, True
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause, True
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him., True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?, True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
It is the curse of kings to be attended, True
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant, True
To break within the bloody house of life,, True
And on the winking of authority, True
To understand a law, to know the meaning, True
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns, True
More upon humour than advised respect., True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
Here is your hand and seal for what I did., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth, True
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal, True
Witness against us to damnation!, True
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds, True
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,, True
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,, True
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,, True
This murder had not come into my mind:, True
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,, True
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,, True
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,, True
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;, True
And thou, to be endeared to a king,, True
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince., True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
My lord--, True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause, True
When I spake darkly what I purposed,, True
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,, True
As bid me tell my tale in express words,, True
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,, True
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:, True
But thou didst understand me by my signs, True
And didst in signs again parley with sin;, True
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,, True
And consequently thy rude hand to act, True
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name., True
Out of my sight, and never see me more!, True
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,, True
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:, True
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,, True
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,, True
Hostility and civil tumult reigns, True
Between my conscience and my cousin's death., True
, True
HUBERT, True
, True
Arm you against your other enemies,, True
I'll make a peace between your soul and you., True
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine, True
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,, True
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood., True
Within this bosom never enter'd yet, True
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;, True
And you have slander'd nature in my form,, True
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,, True
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind, True
Than to be butcher of an innocent child., True
, True
KING JOHN, True
, True
Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,, True
Throw this report on their incensed rage,, True
And make them tame to their obedience!, True
Forgive the comment that my passion made, True
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,, True
And foul imaginary eyes of blood, True
Presented thee more hideous than thou art., True
O, answer not, but to my closet bring, True
The angry lords with all expedient haste., True
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast., True
, True
Exeunt, True
, True
SCENE III. Before the castle., True
, True
Enter ARTHUR, on the walls, True
, True
ARTHUR, True
, True
The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:, True
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!, True
There's few or none do know me: if they did,, True
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite., True
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it., True
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,, True
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:, True
As good to die and go, as die and stay., True
, True
Leaps down, True
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:, True
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!, True

Dies, True

Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:, True
It is our safety, and we must embrace, True
This gentle offer of the perilous time., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?, True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,, True

Is much more general than these lines import., True
, True
BIGOT, True
, True
To-morrow morning let us meet him then., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be, True
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet., True
, True
Enter the BASTARD, True
, True
BASTARD, True
, True
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!, True
The king by me requests your presence straight., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:, True
We will not line his thin bestained cloak, True
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot, True
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks., True
Return and tell him so: we know the worst., True
, True
BASTARD, True

Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now., True

O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!, True
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed., True

Murder, as hating what himself hath done,, True
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge., True

BIGOT, True
, True
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,, True
Found it too precious-princely for a grave., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,, True
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?, True
Or do you almost think, although you see,, True
That you do see? could thought, without this object,, True
Form such another? This is the very top,, True
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,, True
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,, True
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,, True
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage, True
Presented to the tears of soft remorse., True
, True
PEMBROKE, True
, True
All murders past do stand excused in this:, True
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,, True
Shall give a holiness, a purity,, True
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;, True
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,, True
Exampled by this heinous spectacle., True

, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
If that it be the work of any hand!, True
We had a kind of light what would ensue:, True
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;, True
The practise and the purpose of the king:, True
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,, True
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,, True
And breathing to his breathless excellence, True
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,, True
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,, True
Never to be infected with delight,, True
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,, True
Till I have set a glory to this hand,, True
By giving it the worship of revenge., True

My date of life out for his sweet life's loss., True
, True
SALISBURY, True

Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,, True

The life, the right and truth of all this realm, True
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left, True
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth, True

To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed., True
Our discontented counties do revolt;, True
Our people quarrel with obedience,, True
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul, True
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty., True
This inundation of mistemper'd humour, True
Rests by you only to be qualified:, True
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,, True
That present medicine must be minister'd,, True
Or overthrow incurable ensues., True
, True
CARDINAL PANDULPH, True
, True
It was my breath that blew this tempest up,, True
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;, True

After they heard young Arthur was alive?, True

Be great in act, as you have been in thought;, True
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust, True
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:, True
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;, True
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow, True

That borrow their behaviors from the great,, True
Grow great by your example and put on, True
The dauntless spirit of resolution., True
Away, and glister like the god of war,, True
When he intendeth to become the field:, True
Show boldness and aspiring confidence., True
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,, True
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?, True
O, let it not be said: forage, and run, True
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,, True
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh., True

A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,, True
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,, True
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,, True
And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:, True
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;, True

, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
Upon our sides it never shall be broken., True
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear, True
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith, True
To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,, True
I am not glad that such a sore of time, True
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,, True
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound, True
By making many. O, it grieves my soul,, True
That I must draw this metal from my side, True
To be a widow-maker! O, and there, True
Where honourable rescue and defence, True
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!, True
But such is the infection of the time,, True
That, for the health and physic of our right,, True
We cannot deal but with the very hand, True
Of stern injustice and confused wrong., True
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,, True
That we, the sons and children of this isle,, True
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;, True
Wherein we step after a stranger march, True
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up, True
Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep, True
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--, True
To grace the gentry of a land remote,, True
And follow unacquainted colours here?, True
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!, True
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,, True
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,, True
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;, True
Where these two Christian armies might combine, True
The blood of malice in a vein of league,, True
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!, True
, True
LEWIS, True
, True
A noble temper dost thou show in this;, True
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom, True
Doth make an earthquake of nobility., True
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought, True
Between compulsion and a brave respect!, True
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,, True
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:, True
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,, True
Being an ordinary inundation;, True
But this effusion of such manly drops,, True
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,, True
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed, True
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven, True
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors., True
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,, True
And with a great heart heave away the storm:, True
Commend these waters to those baby eyes, True
That never saw the giant world enraged;, True
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,, True
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping., True
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep, True
Into the purse of rich prosperity, True

The next is this, King John hath reconciled, True
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,, True
That so stood out against the holy church,, True
The great metropolis and see of Rome:, True
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;, True
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,, True
That like a lion foster'd up at hand,, True
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,, True
And be no further harmful than in show., True
, True
LEWIS, True
, True
Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:, True
I am too high-born to be propertied,, True
To be a secondary at control,, True
Or useful serving-man and instrument,, True
To any sovereign state throughout the world., True
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars, True
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,, True
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;, True
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out, True
With that same weak wind which enkindled it., True
You taught me how to know the face of right,, True
Acquainted me with interest to this land,, True
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;, True
And come ye now to tell me John hath made, True
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?, True
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,, True
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;, True
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back, True
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?, True
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,, True
What men provided, what munition sent,, True
To underprop this action? Is't not I, True
That undergo this charge? who else but I,, True
And such as to my claim are liable,, True
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?, True
Have I not heard these islanders shout out, True
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?, True
Have I not here the best cards for the game,, True

To outlook conquest and to win renown, True
Even in the jaws of danger and of death., True

BASTARD, True
, True
By all the blood that ever fury breathed,, True
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;, True
For thus his royalty doth speak in me., True
He is prepared, and reason too he should:, True
This apish and unmannerly approach,, True
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,, True
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,, True
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared, True
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,, True
From out the circle of his territories., True
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,, True
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,, True
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,, True
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,, True
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,, True
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out, True
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake, True
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,, True
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;, True
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,, True
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?, True
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms, True
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,, True
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest., True
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,, True
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb, True
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;, True
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids, True
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,, True
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,, True
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts, True
To fierce and bloody inclination., True

BASTARD, True
, True
Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;, True
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start, True
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,, True
And even at hand a drum is ready braced, True
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;, True
Sound but another, and another shall, True
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear, True
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,, True
Not trusting to this halting legate here,, True
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need, True
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits, True
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day, True
To feast upon whole thousands of the French., True

Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,, True
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak, True
My body shall make good upon this earth,, True
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven., True
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,, True

Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,, True

Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;, True
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:, True
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast, True
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:, True
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me, True
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;, True
Which else would post until it had return'd, True
These terms of treason doubled down his throat., True
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,, True
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,, True
I do defy him, and I spit at him;, True
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:, True
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,, True

By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie., True
, True
HENRY BOLINGBROKE, True

Like a false traitor and injurious villain., True
Besides I say and will in battle prove,, True

That ever was survey'd by English eye,, True
That all the treasons for these eighteen years, True
Complotted and contrived in this land, True
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring., True
Further I say and further will maintain, True
Upon his bad life to make all this good,, True
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,, True
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,, True
And consequently, like a traitor coward,, True
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:, True
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,, True

To me for justice and rough chastisement;, True

KING RICHARD II, True

Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:, True

Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood, True

Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,, True
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest., True
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais, True
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;, True
The other part reserved I by consent,, True
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt, True
Upon remainder of a dear account,, True
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:, True
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,, True
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace, True
Neglected my sworn duty in that case., True
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,, True
The honourable father to my foe, True
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,, True
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul, True
But ere I last received the sacrament, True
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd, True
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it., True
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,, True
It issues from the rancour of a villain,, True
A recreant and most degenerate traitor, True
Which in myself I boldly will defend;, True
And interchangeably hurl down my gage, True

Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,, True

In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,, True
Who was the model of thy father's life., True
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:, True
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,, True
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,, True
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:, True

Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;, True

More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:, True
The setting sun, and music at the close,, True

To please the king I did; to please myself, True
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause, True
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,, True
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest, True
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,, True
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,, True
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul, True
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,, True
More than with parting from my lord the king., True
, True
BUSHY, True
, True
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,, True
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;, True
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,, True

Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon, True

Looking awry upon your lord's departure,, True
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;, True
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows, True
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,, True
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;, True

That he, our hope, might have retired his power,, True

Despair not, madam., True

QUEEN, True

These high wild hills and rough uneven ways, True
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,, True

Making the hard way sweet and delectable., True
But I bethink me what a weary way, True
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found, True
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,, True
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled, True
The tediousness and process of my travel:, True
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have, True
The present benefit which I possess;, True
And hope to joy is little less in joy, True

What was his reason?, True
He was not so resolved when last we spake together., True

DUKE OF YORK, True

Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:, True

'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay., True
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd, True

With too much urging your pernicious lives,, True
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood, True
From off my hands, here in the view of men, True
I will unfold some causes of your deaths., True
You have misled a prince, a royal king,, True

By you unhappied and disfigured clean:, True
You have in manner with your sinful hours, True
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,, True
Broke the possession of a royal bed, True
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks, True
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs., True
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,, True
Near to the king in blood, and near in love, True
Till you did make him misinterpret me,, True
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,, True
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,, True
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;, True
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,, True
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,, True
From my own windows torn my household coat,, True

As a long-parted mother with her child, True
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,, True
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,, True
And do thee favours with my royal hands., True
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,, True
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;, True
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,, True
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,, True
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet, True
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:, True
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;, True
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,, True
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder, True
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch, True
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies., True
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:, True

Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not, True
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,, True
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,, True
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen, True
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;, True
But when from under this terrestrial ball, True
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines, True
And darts his light through every guilty hole,, True
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,, True
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,, True
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?, True
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,, True
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night, True
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,, True
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,, True
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,, True
Not able to endure the sight of day,, True
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin., True
Not all the water in the rough rude sea, True
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;, True
The breath of worldly men cannot depose, True
The deputy elected by the Lord:, True
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd, True

The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold., True
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care, True

Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?, True
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,, True
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:, True
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;, True
They break their faith to God as well as us:, True
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:, True

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, True

Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd, True
To bear the tidings of calamity., True
Like an unseasonable stormy day,, True
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,, True
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,, True
So high above his limits swells the rage, True
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land, True
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel., True
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps, True
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,, True
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints, True
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:, True
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows, True
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;, True
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills, True
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,, True
And all goes worse than I have power to tell., True

Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!, True
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war, True
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!, True
, True
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, True
, True
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,, True
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:, True
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made, True
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse, True
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound, True
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground., True

Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes, True
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,, True
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:, True
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath, True
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?, True
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,, True
And nothing can we call our own but death, True
And that small model of the barren earth, True
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones., True
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground, True
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;, True
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,, True
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;, True
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;, True
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown, True
That rounds the mortal temples of a king, True
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,, True
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,, True
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,, True
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,, True
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,, True
As if this flesh which walls about our life,, True
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus, True
Comes at the last and with a little pin, True
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!, True
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood, True
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,, True
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,, True
For you have but mistook me all this while:, True
I live with bread like you, feel want,, True

BISHOP OF CARLISLE, True
, True
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,, True
But presently prevent the ways to wail., True
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,, True
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,, True
And so your follies fight against yourself., True
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:, True
And fight and die is death destroying death;, True
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath., True

Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come, True
To change blows with thee for our day of doom., True

An easy task it is to win our own., True
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?, True
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour., True

My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say., True
I play the torturer, by small and small, True
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:, True
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,, True
And all your northern castles yielded up,, True
And all your southern gentlemen in arms, True
Upon his party., True

Of that sweet way I was in to despair!, True
What say you now? what comfort have we now?, True
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly, True
That bids me be of comfort any more., True
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;, True
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey., True
That power I have, discharge; and let them go, True
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,, True
For I have none: let no man speak again, True
To alter this, for counsel is but vain., True

NORTHUMBERLAND, True
, True
The news is very fair and good, my lord:, True
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head., True

Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,, True
Provided that my banishment repeal'd, True

The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke, True
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench, True
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,, True
My stooping duty tenderly shall show., True
Go, signify as much, while here we march, True
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain., True
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,, True
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements, True
Our fair appointments may be well perused., True
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet, True
With no less terror than the elements, True
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock, True
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven., True
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:, True
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain, True
My waters; on the earth, and not on him., True

Have torn their souls by turning them from us,, True

Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,, True
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf, True
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike, True
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,, True

Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,, True
With too much riches it confound itself:, True

His face still combating with tears and smiles,, True
The badges of his grief and patience,, True

Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is, True

I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,, True
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,, True

Is not the causer of the timeless deaths, True
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,, True
As blameful as the executioner?, True
, True
LADY ANNE, True
, True
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect., True

Your beauty was the cause of that effect;, True
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep, True

Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine., True

Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!, True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
I would they were, that I might die at once;, True
For now they kill me with a living death., True
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,, True
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:, True
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,, True
No, when my father York and Edward wept,, True
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made, True
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;, True
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,, True
Told the sad story of my father's death,, True
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,, True
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks, True
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time, True
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;, True
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,, True
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping., True
I never sued to friend nor enemy;, True
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;, True
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,, True
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak., True
, True
She looks scornfully at him, True
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made, True
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt., True
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,, True
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;, True
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom., True
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,, True
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,, True
And humbly beg the death upon my knee., True
, True
He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword, True
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,, True
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me., True
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,, True
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on., True
, True
Here she lets fall the sword, True
Take up the sword again, or take up me., True
, True
LADY ANNE, True
, True
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,, True
I will not be the executioner., True

LADY ANNE, True
, True
I have already., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Tush, that was in thy rage:, True
Speak it again, and, even with the word,, True
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,, True

To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary., True

Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever., True

What is it?, True

What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,, True
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,, True
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,, True
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;, True
Having God, her conscience, and these bars, True
against me,, True
And I nothing to back my suit at all,, True
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,, True
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!, True
Ha!, True
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,, True
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,, True
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?, True
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,, True
Framed in the prodigality of nature,, True
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,, True
The spacious world cannot again afford, True
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,, True
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,, True
And made her widow to a woful bed?, True
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?, True
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?, True
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,, True
I do mistake my person all this while:, True
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,, True
Myself to be a marvellous proper man., True
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,, True
And entertain some score or two of tailors,, True
To study fashions to adorn my body:, True
Since I am crept in favour with myself,, True
Will maintain it with some little cost., True

DERBY, True

They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:, True
Who are they that complain unto the king,, True
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?, True

Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,, True
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,, True
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,, True
I must be held a rancorous enemy., True

GLOUCESTER, True

Why looks your grace so heavily today?, True
, True
CLARENCE, True
, True
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,, True
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,, True
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,, True
I would not spend another such a night,, True
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,, True
So full of dismal terror was the time!, True
, True
BRAKENBURY, True
, True
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it., True
, True
CLARENCE, True
, True
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,, True
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;, True
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;, True
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk, True
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,, True
And cited up a thousand fearful times,, True
During the wars of York and Lancaster, True
That had befall'n us. As we paced along, True
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,, True
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,, True
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,, True
Into the tumbling billows of the main., True
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!, True
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!, True
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!, True
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;, True
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;, True
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,, True
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,, True
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:, True
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes, True
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,, True
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,, True
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,, True
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by., True
, True
BRAKENBURY, True
, True
Had you such leisure in the time of death, True
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?, True
, True
CLARENCE, True
, True
Methought I had; and often did I strive, True
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood, True
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth, True
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;, True
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,, True
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea., True
, True
BRAKENBURY, True
, True
Awaked you not with this sore agony?, True
, True
CLARENCE, True
, True
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;, True
O, then began the tempest to my soul,, True
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,, True
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,, True
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night., True
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,, True
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;, True
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury, True
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?', True
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by, True
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair, True
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,, True
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,, True
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;, True
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!', True
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends, True
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears, True
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise, True
I trembling waked, and for a season after, True
Could not believe but that I was in hell,, True
Such terrible impression made the dream., True
, True
BRAKENBURY, True
, True
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;, True
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it., True
, True
CLARENCE, True
, True
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,, True
Which now bear evidence against my soul,, True
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!, True
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,, True
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,, True
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,, True
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!, True
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;, True
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep., True
, True
BRAKENBURY, True
, True
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!, True
, True
CLARENCE sleeps, True
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,, True
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night., True
Princes have but their tides for their glories,, True
An outward honour for an inward toil;, True
And, for unfelt imagination,, True
They often feel a world of restless cares:, True
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,, True
There's nothing differs but the outward fame., True

Second Murderer, True
, True
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show, True
him our commission; talk no more., True
, True
BRAKENBURY reads it, True
, True
BRAKENBURY, True
, True
I am, in this, commanded to deliver, True
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:, True
I will not reason what is meant hereby,, True
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning., True
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:, True
I'll to the king; and signify to him, True
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you., True

When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till, True
the judgment-day., True
, True

, True
Second Murderer, True

of remorse in me., True
, True
First Murderer, True
, True
What, art thou afraid?, True
, True
Second Murderer, True
, True
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be, True
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us., True

I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour, True
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one, True
would tell twenty., True

Second Murderer, True

I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it, True
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it, True
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;, True
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it, True
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that, True
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of, True
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold, True
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it, True
is turned out of all towns and cities for a, True
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live, True
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live, True
without it., True

No, uncle; but our crosses on the way, True
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy, True
I want more uncles here to welcome me., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years, True
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit, True
Nor more can you distinguish of a man, True
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,, True
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart., True
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;, True
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,, True

On what occasion, God he knows, not I,, True
The queen your mother, and your brother York,, True
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince, True
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,, True
But by his mother was perforce withheld., True

BUCKINGHAM, True

Fie, what an indirect and peevish course, True
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace, True
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York, True
Unto his princely brother presently?, True
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,, True
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce., True
, True
CARDINAL, True
, True
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory, True
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,, True
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate, True

We should infringe the holy privilege, True
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land, True
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,, True
Too ceremonious and traditional, True
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,, True
You break not sanctuary in seizing him., True
The benefit thereof is always granted, True
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,, True
And those who have the wit to claim the place:, True
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;, True
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:, True
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,, True
You break no privilege nor charter there., True
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;, True
But sanctuary children ne'er till now., True

Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,, True
I moralize two meanings in one word., True
, True
PRINCE EDWARD, True
, True
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;, True
With what his valour did enrich his wit,, True
His wit set down to make his valour live, True
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;, True
For now he lives in fame, though not in life., True
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--, True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True

YORK, True

Then is he more beholding to you than I., True

Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him., True
, True
YORK, True
, True
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:, True
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;, True
Because that I am little, like an ape,, True
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True

With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!, True
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,, True
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:, True
So cunning and so young is wonderful., True

Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us, True
Whereof I shall not have intelligence., True
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:, True

CATESBY, True

Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward, True

After he once fell in with Mistress Shore., True

GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Yet had not we determined he should die,, True
Until your lordship came to see his death;, True
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,, True
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:, True
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard, True
The traitor speak, and timorously confess, True
The manner and the purpose of his treason;, True
That you might well have signified the same, True
Unto the citizens, who haply may, True
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death., True

Lord Mayor, True

Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:, True
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,, True
Only for saying he would make his son, True
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,, True
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so., True
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury, True
And bestial appetite in change of lust;, True
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,, True
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,, True
Without control, listed to make his prey., True
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:, True
Tell them, when that my mother went with child, True
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York, True
My princely father then had wars in France, True
And, by just computation of the time,, True
Found that the issue was not his begot;, True
Which well appeared in his lineaments,, True
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:, True

This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;, True

That it may be this day read over in Paul's., True
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:, True
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,, True
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;, True
The precedent was full as long a-doing:, True
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,, True
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty, True
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,, True

I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,, True

The insatiate greediness of his desires,, True
And his enforcement of the city wives;, True
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,, True
As being got, your father then in France,, True
His resemblance, being not like the duke;, True
Withal I did infer your lineaments,, True
Being the right idea of your father,, True
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;, True
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,, True
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,, True
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:, True
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose, True
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse, True

I bid them that did love their country's good, True
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!', True

GLOUCESTER, True

Ah! and did they so?, True

BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;, True
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,, True
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale., True
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;, True
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:, True
His answer was, the people were not wont, True
To be spoke to but by the recorder., True
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,, True
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;', True
But nothing spake in warrant from himself., True
When he had done, some followers of mine own,, True
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,, True
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!', True
And thus I took the vantage of those few,, True
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;, True
'This general applause and loving shout, True
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:', True
And even here brake off, and came away., True

The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;, True
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:, True
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,, True
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;, True
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:, True
And be not easily won to our request:, True
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it., True
, True

Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,, True
What says he?, True
, True
CATESBY, True
, True
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;, True
To visit him to-morrow or next day:, True
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,, True
Divinely bent to meditation;, True
And no worldly suit would he be moved,, True
To draw him from his holy exercise., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;, True
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,, True
In deep designs and matters of great moment,, True
No less importing than our general good,, True

I'll tell him what you say, my lord., True
, True
Exit, True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!, True
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,, True
But on his knees at meditation;, True
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,, True
But meditating with two deep divines;, True
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,, True
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:, True
Happy were England, would this gracious prince, True
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:, True
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it., True
, True
Lord Mayor, True
, True
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!, True

How now, Catesby, what says your lord?, True
, True
CATESBY, True
, True
My lord,, True
He wonders to what end you have assembled, True
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,, True
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:, True
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
Sorry I am my noble cousin should, True
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:, True
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;, True
And so once more return and tell his grace., True
, True
Exit CATESBY, True
When holy and devout religious men, True
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,, True
So sweet is zealous contemplation., True
, True
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns, True
, True
Lord Mayor, True
, True
See, where he stands between two clergymen!, True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,, True
To stay him from the fall of vanity:, True
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,, True
True ornaments to know a holy man., True
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,, True
Lend favourable ears to our request;, True
And pardon us the interruption, True
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
My lord, there needs no such apology:, True
I rather do beseech you pardon me,, True
Who, earnest in the service of my God,, True
Neglect the visitation of my friends., True
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?, True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,, True
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
I do suspect I have done some offence, True
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,, True
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,, True
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!, True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?, True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
Then know, it is your fault that you resign, True
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,, True
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,, True
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,, True
The lineal glory of your royal house,, True
To the corruption of a blemished stock:, True
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,, True
Which here we waken to our country's good,, True
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;, True
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,, True
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,, True
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf, True
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion., True
Which to recure, we heartily solicit, True
Your gracious self to take on you the charge, True
And kingly government of this your land,, True
Not as protector, steward, substitute,, True
Or lowly factor for another's gain;, True
But as successively from blood to blood,, True
Your right of birth, your empery, your own., True
For this, consorted with the citizens,, True
Your very worshipful and loving friends,, True
And by their vehement instigation,, True
In this just suit come I to move your grace., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
I know not whether to depart in silence,, True
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof., True
Best fitteth my degree or your condition, True
If not to answer, you might haply think, True
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded, True
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,, True
Which fondly you would here impose on me;, True
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,, True
So season'd with your faithful love to me., True
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends., True
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,, True
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,, True
Definitively thus I answer you., True
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert, True
Unmeritable shuns your high request., True
First if all obstacles were cut away,, True
And that my path were even to the crown,, True
As my ripe revenue and due by birth, True
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,, True
So mighty and so many my defects,, True
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,, True
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,, True
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,, True
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd., True
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,, True
And much I need to help you, if need were;, True
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,, True
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,, True
Will well become the seat of majesty,, True
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign., True
On him I lay what you would lay on me,, True
The right and fortune of his happy stars;, True
Which God defend that I should wring from him!, True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;, True
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,, True
All circumstances well considered., True
You say that Edward is your brother's son:, True
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;, True
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--, True
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--, True
And afterward by substitute betroth'd, True
To Bona, sister to the King of France., True
These both put by a poor petitioner,, True
A care-crazed mother of a many children,, True
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,, True
Even in the afternoon of her best days,, True
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,, True
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts, True
To base declension and loathed bigamy, True
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got, True
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince., True
More bitterly could I expostulate,, True
Save that, for reverence to some alive,, True
I give a sparing limit to my tongue., True
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self, True
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;, True
If non to bless us and the land withal,, True
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry, True
From the corruption of abusing times,, True
Unto a lineal true-derived course., True

Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?, True
I am unfit for state and majesty;, True
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;, True
I cannot nor I will not yield to you., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True
, True
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,, True
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;, True
As well we know your tenderness of heart, True
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,, True
Which we have noted in you to your kin,, True
And egally indeed to all estates,--, True
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,, True
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;, True
But we will plant some other in the throne,, True
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:, True

Albeit against my conscience and my soul., True
, True
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest, True
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,, True
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,, True
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,, True
I must have patience to endure the load:, True
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach, True
Attend the sequel of your imposition,, True
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me, True
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;, True
For God he knows, and you may partly see,, True
How far I am from the desire thereof., True
, True
Lord Mayor, True

Aside to SATURNINUS, True

Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:, True
You are but newly planted in your throne;, True
Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,, True
Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,, True
And so supplant you for ingratitude,, True
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,, True
Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:, True
I'll find a day to massacre them all, True
And raze their faction and their family,, True
The cruel father and his traitorous sons,, True
To whom I sued for my dear son's life,, True
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen, True
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain., True

Aloud, True
Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;, True
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart, True

AARON, True

Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,, True
Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,, True
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;, True
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach., True
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,, True
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,, True
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,, True
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;, True
So Tamora:, True
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,, True
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown., True
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,, True
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,, True
And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long, True
Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains, True
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes, True
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus., True
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!, True
I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,, True
To wait upon this new-made empress., True
To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,, True
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,, True
This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,, True
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's., True
Holloa! what storm is this?, True

Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving, True
, True
DEMETRIUS, True

Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,, True

And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be., True

CHIRON, True
, True
Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;, True
And so in this, to bear me down with braves., True
'Tis not the difference of a year or two, True
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:, True
I am as able and as fit as thou, True
To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;, True
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,, True
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love., True

the peace., True
, True
DEMETRIUS, True
, True
Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,, True
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,, True
Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?, True
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath, True
Till you know better how to handle it., True
, True
CHIRON, True

Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,, True
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare., True

Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?, True
, True
They draw, True

AARON, True
, True
[Coming forward] Why, how now, lords!, True
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,, True
And maintain such a quarrel openly?, True
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:, True
I would not for a million of gold, True
The cause were known to them it most concerns;, True
Nor would your noble mother for much more, True
Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome., True
For shame, put up., True
, True
DEMETRIUS, True
, True
Not I, till I have sheathed, True
My rapier in his bosom and withal, True
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat, True
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here., True
, True
CHIRON, True
, True
For that I am prepared and full resolved., True
Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,, True
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!, True
, True
AARON, True
, True
Away, I say!, True
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,, True
This petty brabble will undo us all., True
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous, True
It is to jet upon a prince's right?, True
What, is Lavinia then become so loose,, True
Or Bassianus so degenerate,, True
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd, True
Without controlment, justice, or revenge?, True
Young lords, beware! and should the empress know, True
This discord's ground, the music would not please., True

Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:, True
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope., True
, True
AARON, True

Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome, True
How furious and impatient they be,, True
And cannot brook competitors in love?, True
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths, True
By this device., True
, True
CHIRON, True
, True
Aaron, a thousand deaths, True
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love., True
, True
AARON, True
, True
To achieve her! how?, True
, True
DEMETRIUS, True
, True
Why makest thou it so strange?, True
She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;, True
She is a woman, therefore may be won;, True
She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved., True
What, man! more water glideth by the mill, True
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is, True
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:, True
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother., True
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge., True
, True
AARON, True
, True
[Aside] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may., True
, True
DEMETRIUS, True

Then why should he despair that knows to court it, True
With words, fair looks and liberality?, True
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,, True
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?, True
, True
AARON, True
, True
Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so, True
Would serve your turns., True
, True
CHIRON, True

Ay, so the turn were served., True
, True
DEMETRIUS, True
, True
Aaron, thou hast hit it., True

AARON, True

Would you had hit it too!, True
Then should not we be tired with this ado., True
Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools, True
To square for this? would it offend you, then, True
That both should speed?, True

Nor me, so I were one., True
, True
AARON, True
, True
For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:, True
'Tis policy and stratagem must do, True
That you affect; and so must you resolve,, True
That what you cannot as you would achieve,, True
You must perforce accomplish as you may., True
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste, True
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love., True
A speedier course than lingering languishment, True
Must we pursue, and I have found the path., True
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;, True
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:, True
The forest walks are wide and spacious;, True
And many unfrequented plots there are, True
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:, True
Single you thither then this dainty doe,, True
And strike her home by force, if not by words:, True
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope., True
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit, True
To villany and vengeance consecrate,, True
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;, True
And she shall file our engines with advice,, True
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,, True
But to your wishes' height advance you both., True
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,, True
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:, True
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;, True
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take, True
your turns;, True
There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,, True
And revel in Lavinia's treasury., True

Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,, True

Uncouple here and let us make a bay, True

That all the court may echo with the noise., True
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,, True
To attend the emperor's person carefully:, True
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,, True

Enter AARON, with a bag of gold, True
, True
AARON, True
, True
He that had wit would think that I had none,, True
To bury so much gold under a tree,, True
And never after to inherit it., True
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly, True
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,, True
Which, cunningly effected, will beget, True
A very excellent piece of villany:, True
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest, True

My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,, True
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?, True
The birds chant melody on every bush,, True
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,, True
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind, True
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:, True
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,, True
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,, True
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,, True
As if a double hunt were heard at once,, True
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;, True
And, after conflict such as was supposed, True
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,, True
When with a happy storm they were surprised, True
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,, True
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,, True
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;, True
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds, True
Be unto us as is a nurse's song, True
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep., True

Madam, though Venus govern your desires,, True
Saturn is dominator over mine:, True
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,, True
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,, True
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls, True
Even as an adder when she doth unroll, True
To do some fatal execution?, True
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:, True
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,, True
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head., True
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,, True
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,, True
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:, True
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,, True
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity, True
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood., True
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,, True
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll., True
Now question me no more; we are espied;, True
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,, True

BASSIANUS, True
, True
Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,, True
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?, True
Or is it Dian, habited like her,, True
Who hath abandoned her holy groves, True
To see the general hunting in this forest?, True
, True
TAMORA, True
, True
Saucy controller of our private steps!, True
Had I the power that some say Dian had,, True
Thy temples should be planted presently, True
With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds, True
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,, True
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!, True
, True
LAVINIA, True
, True
Under your patience, gentle empress,, True
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;, True

, True
BASSIANUS, True
, True
Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian, True
Doth make your honour of his body's hue,, True
Spotted, detested, and abominable., True
Why are you sequester'd from all your train,, True
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed., True
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,, True
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,, True
If foul desire had not conducted you?, True
, True
LAVINIA, True
, True
And, being intercepted in your sport,, True
Great reason that my noble lord be rated, True

How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!, True
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?, True
, True
TAMORA, True
, True
Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?, True
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:, True
A barren detested vale, you see it is;, True
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,, True
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:, True
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,, True
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:, True
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,, True
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,, True
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,, True
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,, True
Would make such fearful and confused cries, True
As any mortal body hearing it, True
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly., True
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,, True
But straight they told me they would bind me here, True
Unto the body of a dismal yew,, True
And leave me to this miserable death:, True
And then they call'd me foul adulteress,, True
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms, True
That ever ear did hear to such effect:, True
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,, True
This vengeance on me had they executed., True
Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,, True
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children., True

Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;, True
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:, True

And shall she carry this unto her grave?, True
, True
CHIRON, True

When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?, True

The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:, True
O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,, True
Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!, True

O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,, True

What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go., True

That I may slumber in eternal sleep!, True
Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands, True
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare, True
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,, True
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,, True
And might not gain so great a happiness, True
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?, True
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,, True
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,, True
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,, True

Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of execution; TITUS going before, pleading, True
, True
TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!, True
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent, True
In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;, True
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;, True
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;, True
And for these bitter tears, which now you see, True
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;, True
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,, True
Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought., True
For two and twenty sons I never wept,, True
Because they died in honour's lofty bed., True
, True
Lieth down; the Judges, & c., pass by him, and Exeunt, True
For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write, True
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:, True
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;, True
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush., True
O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,, True
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,, True
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:, True
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;, True
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow, True
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,, True
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood., True
, True
Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn, True
O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!, True
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;, True
And let me say, that never wept before,, True
My tears are now prevailing orators., True
, True
LUCIUS, True
, True
O noble father, you lament in vain:, True
The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;, True

TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead., True
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--, True

My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak., True
, True
TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,, True
They would not mark me, or if they did mark,, True
They would not pity me, yet plead I must;, True
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;, True
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,, True
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,, True
For that they will not intercept my tale:, True
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet, True
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;, True
And, were they but attired in grave weeds,, True
Rome could afford no tribune like to these., True
A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;, True
A stone is silent, and offendeth not,, True
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death., True
, True
Rises, True
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?, True
, True
LUCIUS, True
, True
To rescue my two brothers from their death:, True

My everlasting doom of banishment., True

TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
O happy man! they have befriended thee., True
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive, True
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?, True
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey, True
But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,, True
From these devourers to be banished!, True
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?, True

Will it consume me? let me see it, then., True

Ay me, this object kills me!, True
, True
TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her., True
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand, True
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?, True
What fool hath added water to the sea,, True
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?, True
My grief was at the height before thou camest,, True
And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds., True
Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;, True
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;, True
And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;, True
In bootless prayer have they been held up,, True
And they have served me to effectless use:, True
Now all the service I require of them, True
Is that the one will help to cut the other., True
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;, True
For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain., True
, True

Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?, True
, True
MARCUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
O, that delightful engine of her thoughts, True
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,, True
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,, True
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung, True
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!, True
, True

, True
O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?, True
, True
MARCUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
O, thus I found her, straying in the park,, True
Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer, True
That hath received some unrecuring wound., True
, True
TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
It was my deer; and he that wounded her, True
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:, True
For now I stand as one upon a rock, True
Environed with a wilderness of sea,, True
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,, True
Expecting ever when some envious surge, True
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him., True
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;, True
Here stands my other son, a banished man,, True
And here my brother, weeping at my woes., True
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,, True
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul., True
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,, True
It would have madded me: what shall I do, True
Now I behold thy lively body so?, True
Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:, True
Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:, True
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death, True
Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this., True
Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!, True
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears, True
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew, True
Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd., True
, True
MARCUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;, True
Perchance because she knows them innocent., True
, True
TITUS ANDRONICUS, True
, True
If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful, True
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them., True
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;, True
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes., True
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips., True
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:, True
Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,, True
And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,, True
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks, True
How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,, True
With miry slime left on them by a flood?, True
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long, True
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,, True
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?, True
Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?, True
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows, True
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?, True
What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,, True
Plot some deuce of further misery,, True
To make us wonder'd at in time to come., True
, True
LUCIUS, True
, True
Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,, True
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps., True

Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,, True

Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks., True
, True
TITUS ANDRONICUS, True

Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:, True
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say, True
That to her brother which I said to thee:, True
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,, True
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks., True

As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!, True

Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?, True

To ransom my two nephews from their death;, True

She says she drinks no other drink but tears,, True
Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:, True
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;, True
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect, True

However these disturbers of our peace, True

Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,, True
His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?, True
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:, True
See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;, True
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;, True
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!, True
What's this but libelling against the senate,, True
And blazoning our injustice every where?, True
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?, True
As who would say, in Rome no justice were., True
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies, True
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:, True

For these contempts., True
, True
Aside, True
Why, thus it shall become, True
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:, True

The eagle suffers little birds to sing,, True

Knowing that with the shadow of his wings, True
He can at pleasure stint their melody:, True
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome., True
Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,, True
I will enchant the old Andronicus, True
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,, True
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,, True
When as the one is wounded with the bait,, True

To AEmilius, True

Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd, True

Upon the wasted building, suddenly, True
I heard a child cry underneath a wall., True
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard, True
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:, True
'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!, True
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,, True
Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,, True
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:, True

the babe,--, True

Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey, True
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?, True
Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?, True
A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree., True

Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood, True
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,, True
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;, True

Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance., True

I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush., True
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,, True
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless., True
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,, True
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,, True
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman., True
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?, True
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,, True
Unless the adage must be verified,, True
That beggars mounted run their horse to death., True
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;, True
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:, True
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;, True
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:, True
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;, True
The want thereof makes thee abominable:, True
Thou art as opposite to every good, True

O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!, True
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,, True

Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless., True
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:, True
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:, True

And I with tears do wash the blood away., True
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:, True
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,, True

RICHARD, True
, True
I cannot joy, until I be resolved, True
Where our right valiant father is become., True
I saw him in the battle range about;, True
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth., True
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop, True
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;, True
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,, True
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,, True
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him., True
So fared our father with his enemies;, True
So fled his enemies my warlike father:, True
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son., True

Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak., True
By many hands your father was subdued;, True

Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,, True
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks, True
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood, True
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:, True
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,, True
They took his head, and on the gates of York, True

Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,, True

Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,, True
Were brought me of your loss and his depart., True
I, then in London keeper of the king,, True
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,, True
And very well appointed, as I thought,, True
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,, True
Bearing the king in my behalf along;, True
For by my scouts I was advertised, True
That she was coming with a full intent, True
To dash our late decree in parliament, True
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession., True
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met, True
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:, True
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,, True
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,, True
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;, True
Or whether 'twas report of her success;, True
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,, True
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,, True
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,, True
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;, True
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,, True
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,, True
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends., True
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,, True
With promise of high pay and great rewards:, True
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,, True
And we in them no hope to win the day;, True
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;, True
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,, True

RICHARD, True
, True
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:, True
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak., True
But in this troublous time what's to be done?, True
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,, True
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,, True
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?, True
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes, True
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?, True
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords., True
, True
WARWICK, True

Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;, True

Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,, True
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,, True
And of their feather many more proud birds,, True
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax., True
He swore consent to your succession,, True
His oath enrolled in the parliament;, True
And now to London all the crew are gone,, True
To frustrate both his oath and what beside, True
May make against the house of Lancaster., True
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:, True
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,, True
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,, True
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,, True
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,, True

No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:, True
The next degree is England's royal throne;, True

Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head., True
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,, True
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,, True

Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?, True
Not he that sets his foot upon her back., True
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,, True
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood., True
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,, True
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:, True
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,, True
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;, True
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,, True
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,, True
Which argued thee a most unloving father., True
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;, True
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,, True
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,, True
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings, True

Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,, True
Inferring arguments of mighty force., True
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear, True
That things ill-got had ever bad success?, True
And happy always was it for that son, True
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?, True
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;, True
And would my father had left me no more!, True
For all the rest is held at such a rate, True

Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?, True

EDWARD, True

I am his king, and he should bow his knee;, True
I was adopted heir by his consent:, True
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,, True
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,, True
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,, True

A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,, True
To make this shameless callet know herself., True
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,, True
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;, True
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd, True
By that false woman, as this king by thee., True
His father revell'd in the heart of France,, True
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;, True
And had he match'd according to his state,, True
He might have kept that glory to this day;, True
But when he took a beggar to his bed,, True
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,, True
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,, True
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,, True
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home., True
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?, True
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;, True
And we, in pity of the gentle king,, True
Had slipp'd our claim until another age., True

CLIFFORD, True
, True
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,, True
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light., True
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow, True
More than my body's parting with my soul!, True
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;, True
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts., True
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,, True
The common people swarm like summer flies;, True
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?, True
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?, True
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent, True
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,, True
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!, True
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,, True
Or as thy father and his father did,, True
Giving no ground unto the house of York,, True
They never then had sprung like summer flies;, True
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm, True
Had left no mourning widows for our death;, True
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace., True
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?, True
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?, True
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;, True
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:, True
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;, True
For at their hands I have deserved no pity., True
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,, True
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint., True
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;, True
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast., True

Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,, True
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,, True
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,, True
Command an argosy to stem the waves., True
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?, True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,, True
For, though before his face I speak the words, True
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:, True
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead., True
, True
CLIFFORD groans, and dies, True
, True
EDWARD, True

Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?, True

A deadly groan, like life and death's departing., True

EDWARD, True
, True
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,, True
If friend or foe, let him be gently used., True
, True
RICHARD, True
, True
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;, True
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch, True
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,, True
But set his murdering knife unto the root, True
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,, True
I mean our princely father, Duke of York., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,, True
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;, True
Instead whereof let this supply the room:, True
Measure for measure must be answered., True
, True
EDWARD, True
, True
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,, True
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:, True
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,, True
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
I think his understanding is bereft., True
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?, True
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,, True
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say., True
, True
RICHARD, True
, True
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:, True
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,, True
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts, True

GEORGE, True

Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?, True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont., True
, True
RICHARD, True
, True
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard, True
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath., True
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,, True
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,, True
That I in all despite might rail at him,, True
This hand should chop it off, and with the, True
issuing blood, True
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst, True
York and young Rutland could not satisfy., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,, True
And rear it in the place your father's stands., True
And now to London with triumphant march,, True
There to be crowned England's royal king:, True
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,, True
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:, True
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;, True
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread, True
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;, True
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,, True
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears., True
First will I see the coronation;, True
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,, True
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord., True
, True
EDWARD, True
, True
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;, True
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,, True
And never will I undertake the thing, True
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting., True
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,, True
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,, True
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best., True
, True
RICHARD, True
, True
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;, True
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous., True

WARWICK, True
, True
Tut, that's a foolish observation:, True
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,, True
To see these honours in possession., True

Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands, True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;, True
For through this laund anon the deer will come;, True
And in this covert will we make our stand,, True
Culling the principal of all the deer., True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot., True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow, True
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost., True
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:, True
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,, True
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day, True
In this self-place where now we mean to stand., True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past., True
, True
Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook, True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,, True
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight., True
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;, True
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,, True
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:, True
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,, True
No humble suitors press to speak for right,, True
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;, True
For how can I help them, and not myself?, True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:, True
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,, True
For wise men say it is the wisest course., True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him., True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;, True
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick, True
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister, True
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,, True
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;, True
For Warwick is a subtle orator,, True
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words., True
By this account then Margaret may win him;, True
For she's a woman to be pitied much:, True
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;, True
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;, True
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;, True
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,, True
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears., True
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;, True
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,, True
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward., True
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;, True
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;, True
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;, True
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,, True
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,, True
And in conclusion wins the king from her,, True
With promise of his sister, and what else,, True
To strengthen and support King Edward's place., True
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,, True
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!, True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?, True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:, True
A man at least, for less I should not be;, True
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?, True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough., True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?, True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;, True
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,, True
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:, True
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy., True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,, True
Your crown content and you must be contented, True
To go along with us; for as we think,, True
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;, True
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance, True
Will apprehend you as his enemy., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
But did you never swear, and break an oath?, True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
No, never such an oath; nor will not now., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?, True
, True
Second Keeper, True
, True
Here in this country, where we now remain., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
I was anointed king at nine months old;, True
My father and my grandfather were kings,, True
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:, True
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?, True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
No;, True
For we were subjects but while you were king., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?, True
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!, True
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,, True
And as the air blows it to me again,, True
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,, True
And yielding to another when it blows,, True
Commanded always by the greater gust;, True
Such is the lightness of you common men., True
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin, True
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty., True
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;, True
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey., True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
So would you be again to Henry,, True
If he were seated as King Edward is., True
, True
First Keeper, True
, True
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,, True
To go with us unto the officers., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:, True
And what God will, that let your king perform;, True
And what he will, I humbly yield unto., True

Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field, True
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,, True
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:, True
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;, True
Which we in justice cannot well deny,, True
Because in quarrel of the house of York, True
The worthy gentleman did lose his life., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;, True
It were dishonour to deny it her., True

give her two., True

LADY GREY, True
, True

Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,, True
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,, True
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:, True
A cold premeditation for my purpose!, True
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;, True
Like one that stands upon a promontory,, True
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,, True
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,, True
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,, True
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:, True
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;, True
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;, True
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,, True
Flattering me with impossibilities., True
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,, True
Unless my hand and strength could equal them., True
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;, True
What other pleasure can the world afford?, True
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,, True
And deck my body in gay ornaments,, True
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks., True
O miserable thought! and more unlikely, True
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!, True
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:, True
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,, True
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,, True
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;, True
To make an envious mountain on my back,, True
Where sits deformity to mock my body;, True
To shape my legs of an unequal size;, True
To disproportion me in every part,, True
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp, True
That carries no impression like the dam., True
And am I then a man to be beloved?, True
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!, True
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,, True
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such, True
As are of better person than myself,, True
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,, True
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,, True
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head, True
Be round impaled with a glorious crown., True
And yet I know not how to get the crown,, True
For many lives stand between me and home:, True
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,, True
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,, True
Seeking a way and straying from the way;, True
Not knowing how to find the open air,, True
But toiling desperately to find it out,--, True
Torment myself to catch the English crown:, True
And from that torment I will free myself,, True
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe., True
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,, True
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,, True
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,, True
And frame my face to all occasions., True
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;, True
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;, True
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,, True
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,, True
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy., True
I can add colours to the chameleon,, True
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,, True
And set the murderous Machiavel to school., True
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?, True
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down., True

SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace., True
, True
Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA, his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again, True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,, True
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state, True
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret, True
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve, True
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,, True
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:, True
But now mischance hath trod my title down,, True
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;, True
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,, True
And to my humble seat conform myself., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?, True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears, True
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,, True
And sit thee by our side:, True
, True
Seats her by him, True
Yield not thy neck, True
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind, True
Still ride in triumph over all mischance., True
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;, True
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts, True
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak., True
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,, True
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,, True
Is of a king become a banish'd man,, True
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;, True
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York, True
Usurps the regal title and the seat, True
Of England's true-anointed lawful king., True
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,, True
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,, True
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;, True
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:, True
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;, True
Our people and our peers are both misled,, True
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,, True
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,, True
While we bethink a means to break it off., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow., True
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!, True
, True
Enter WARWICK, True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?, True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?, True
, True
He descends. She ariseth, True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;, True
For this is he that moves both wind and tide., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,, True
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,, True
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,, True
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;, True
And then to crave a league of amity;, True
And lastly, to confirm that amity, True
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant, True
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,, True
To England's king in lawful marriage., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
[Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
[To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,, True
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,, True
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue, True
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;, True
Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,, True
Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,, True
Before you answer Warwick. His demand, True
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,, True
But from deceit bred by necessity;, True
For how can tyrants safely govern home,, True
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?, True
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,, True
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,, True
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son., True
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage, True
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;, True
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,, True
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Injurious Margaret!, True
, True
PRINCE EDWARD, True
, True
And why not queen?, True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Because thy father Henry did usurp;, True
And thou no more are prince than she is queen., True
, True
OXFORD, True
, True
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,, True
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;, True
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,, True
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;, True
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,, True
Who by his prowess conquered all France:, True
From these our Henry lineally descends., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,, True
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost, True
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?, True
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that., True
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree, True
Of threescore and two years; a silly time, True
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth., True
, True
OXFORD, True
, True
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,, True
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,, True
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?, True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,, True
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?, True
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king., True
, True
OXFORD, True
, True
Call him my king by whose injurious doom, True
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,, True
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,, True
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,, True
When nature brought him to the door of death?, True
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,, True
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
And I the house of York., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,, True
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,, True
While I use further conference with Warwick., True
, True
They stand aloof, True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!, True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,, True
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath, True
To link with him that were not lawful chosen., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
But is he gracious in the people's eye?, True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
The more that Henry was unfortunate., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Then further, all dissembling set aside,, True
Tell me for truth the measure of his love, True
Unto our sister Bona., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Such it seems, True
As may beseem a monarch like himself., True
Myself have often heard him say and swear, True
That this his love was an eternal plant,, True
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,, True
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,, True
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,, True
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve., True
, True
BONA, True
, True
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:, True
, True
To WARWICK, True
Yet I confess that often ere this day,, True
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,, True
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;, True
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn, True
Touching the jointure that your king must make,, True
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised., True
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness, True
That Bona shall be wife to the English king., True
, True
PRINCE EDWARD, True
, True
To Edward, but not to the English king., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device, True
By this alliance to make void my suit:, True
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend., True
, True
KING LEWIS XI, True
, True
And still is friend to him and Margaret:, True
But if your title to the crown be weak,, True
As may appear by Edward's good success,, True
Then 'tis but reason that I be released, True
From giving aid which late I promised., True
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand, True
That your estate requires and mine can yield., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,, True
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose., True
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,, True
You have a father able to maintain you;, True
And better 'twere you troubled him than France., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,, True
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!, True
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,, True
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold, True
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;, True
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather., True

KING LEWIS XI, True

What! has your king married the Lady Grey!, True
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,, True
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?, True
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?, True
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?, True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
I told your majesty as much before:, True
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,, True
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,, True
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,, True
No more my king, for he dishonours me,, True
But most himself, if he could see his shame., True
Did I forget that by the house of York, True
My father came untimely to his death?, True
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?, True
Did I impale him with the regal crown?, True
Did I put Henry from his native right?, True
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?, True
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:, True
And to repair my honour lost for him,, True
I here renounce him and return to Henry., True
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,, True
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:, True
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,, True
And replant Henry in his former state., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;, True
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,, True
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,, True
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us, True
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,, True
I'll undertake to land them on our coast, True
And force the tyrant from his seat by war., True
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:, True
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,, True
He's very likely now to fall from him,, True
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,, True
Or than for strength and safety of our country., True

BONA, True

Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged, True
But by thy help to this distressed queen?, True

Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?, True
, True
BONA, True

I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.', True

, True
KING EDWARD IV, True

Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,, True

They are already, or quickly will be landed:, True
Myself in person will straight follow you., True

Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,, True
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:, True
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?, True
If it be so, then both depart to him;, True
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:, True
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,, True
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,, True
That I may never have you in suspect., True

Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;, True
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,, True
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:, True
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine., True
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,, True
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,, True
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,, True
And but attended by a simple guard,, True
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?, True
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:, True
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede, True
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,, True

So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,, True
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard, True

Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,, True
That know not how to use ambassadors,, True
Nor how to be contented with one wife,, True
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,, True
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,, True
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?, True
, True
KING EDWARD IV, True
, True
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?, True
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down., True
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,, True
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,, True
Edward will always bear himself as king:, True
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,, True
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:, True

Takes off his crown, True

My Lord of Somerset, at my request,, True
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd, True
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York., True

QUEEN ELIZABETH, True

No, but the loss of his own royal person., True
, True
RIVERS, True
, True
Then is my sovereign slain?, True
, True
QUEEN ELIZABETH, True
, True
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,, True
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard, True
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:, True
And, as I further have to understand,, True
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,, True
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe., True
, True
RIVERS, True
, True
These news I must confess are full of grief;, True
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:, True
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day., True
, True
QUEEN ELIZABETH, True
, True
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay., True
And I the rather wean me from despair, True
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:, True
This is it that makes me bridle passion, True
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;, True
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear, True

Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown, True
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown., True

I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,, True

Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,, True

Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,, True
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands, True
He hath good usage and great liberty,, True
And, often but attended with weak guard,, True
Comes hunting this way to disport himself., True
I have advertised him by secret means, True
That if about this hour he make his way, True
Under the colour of his usual game,, True
He shall here find his friends with horse and men, True

Brother, the time and case requireth haste:, True
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner., True

KING EDWARD IV, True

HASTINGS, True

To Lynn, my lord,, True

My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,, True
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?, True
, True
Lieutenant, True
, True
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;, True

I then crave pardon of your majesty., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?, True
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,, True
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;, True
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds, True
Conceive when after many moody thoughts, True
At last by notes of household harmony, True
They quite forget their loss of liberty., True
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,, True
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;, True
He was the author, thou the instrument., True
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite, True
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,, True
And that the people of this blessed land, True
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,, True
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,, True
I here resign my government to thee,, True
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;, True
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,, True
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,, True

Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,, True
For choosing me when Clarence is in place., True
, True
CLARENCE, True
, True
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,, True
To whom the heavens in thy nativity, True
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,, True

, True
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:, True

To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?, True

CLARENCE, True

That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;, True
For on thy fortune I repose myself., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:, True
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow, True
To Henry's body, and supply his place;, True
I mean, in bearing weight of government,, True
While he enjoys the honour and his ease., True
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful, True

But, with the first of all your chief affairs,, True
Let me entreat, for I command no more,, True
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward, True

Lays his hand on his head, True

This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss., True
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,, True
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,, True
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself, True

, True
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester, True

In secret ambush on the forest side, True
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;, True
For hunting was his daily exercise., True
, True
WARWICK, True

My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;, True

And we shall have more wars before 't be long., True
As Henry's late presaging prophecy, True
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,, True
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts, True
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:, True
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,, True
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,, True
Till storms be past of civil enmity., True

And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?, True
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he, True
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad, True
With tearful eyes add water to the sea, True
And give more strength to that which hath too much,, True
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,, True
Which industry and courage might have saved?, True
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!, True
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?, True
And Montague our topmost; what of him?, True
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?, True
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?, True

For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?, True
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,, True
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,, True
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck., True
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair., True

PRINCE EDWARD, True

Infuse his breast with magnanimity, True
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms., True
I speak not this as doubting any here, True
For did I but suspect a fearful man, True
He should have leave to go away betimes,, True
Lest in our need he might infect another, True

His champions are the prophets and apostles,, True
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,, True

name the several colours we do wear. Sight may, True
distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them, True

BUCKINGHAM, True

Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold., True
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,, True

Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:, True
Noble she is, but if she have forgot, True
Honour and virtue and conversed with such, True
As, like to pitch, defile nobility,, True
I banish her my bed and company, True
And give her as a prey to law and shame,, True
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Well, for this night we will repose us here:, True
To-morrow toward London back again,, True
To look into this business thoroughly, True

WARWICK, True

Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,, True
The Nevils are thy subjects to command., True
, True
YORK, True
, True
Then thus:, True
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:, True
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;, True
The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,, True
Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom, True
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;, True
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;, True
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;, True
William of Windsor was the seventh and last., True
Edward the Black Prince died before his father, True
And left behind him Richard, his only son,, True
Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;, True
Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,, True
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,, True
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,, True
Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,, True
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,, True
And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,, True
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
Father, the duke hath told the truth:, True
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown., True
, True
YORK, True
, True

, True
YORK, True
, True
The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line, True
I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,, True
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:, True

Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor., True
, True
SALISBURY, True
, True
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,, True
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;, True

But to the rest., True

YORK, True
, True
His eldest sister, Anne,, True
My mother, being heir unto the crown, True
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son, True

By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir, True
To Roger Earl of March, who was the son, True
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,, True
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:, True
So, if the issue of the elder son, True
Succeed before the younger, I am king., True
, True
WARWICK, True
, True
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?, True
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,, True
The fourth son; York claims it from the third., True
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:, True
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee, True
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock., True
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;, True
And in this private plot be we the first, True
That shall salute our rightful sovereign, True
With honour of his birthright to the crown., True
, True
BOTH, True
, True
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!, True
, True
YORK, True
, True
We thank you, lords. But I am not your king, True
Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd, True
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;, True
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,, True
But with advice and silent secrecy., True
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:, True
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,, True
At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,, True
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,, True
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,, True
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:, True
'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that, True
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy., True

SALISBURY, True

My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full., True

My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick, True
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king., True

The abject people gazing on thy face,, True
With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,, True
That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels, True

Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!, True
For whilst I think I am thy married wife, True
And thou a prince, protector of this land,, True
Methinks I should not thus be led along,, True
Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,, True
And followed with a rabble that rejoice, True
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans., True
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,, True

And bid me be advised how I tread., True
Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?, True
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,, True
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?, True
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;, True
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell., True
Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,, True

Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was, True

Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock, True

I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:, True
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,, True
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Can you not see? or will ye not observe, True
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?, True
With what a majesty he bears himself,, True
How insolent of late he is become,, True
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?, True
We know the time since he was mild and affable,, True
And if we did but glance a far-off look,, True
Immediately he was upon his knee,, True
That all the court admired him for submission:, True
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,, True
When every one will give the time of day,, True
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,, True
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,, True
Disdaining duty that to us belongs., True
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;, True
But great men tremble when the lion roars;, True
And Humphrey is no little man in England., True
First note that he is near you in descent,, True
And should you fall, he as the next will mount., True
Me seemeth then it is no policy,, True
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears, True
And his advantage following your decease,, True
That he should come about your royal person, True
Or be admitted to your highness' council., True
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,, True
And when he please to make commotion,, True
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him., True
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;, True
Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden, True
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry., True
The reverent care I bear unto my lord, True
Made me collect these dangers in the duke., True
If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;, True
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,, True
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke., True
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,, True
Reprove my allegation, if you can;, True
Or else conclude my words effectual., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Well hath your highness seen into this duke;, True
And, had I first been put to speak my mind,, True
I think I should have told your grace's tale., True
The duchess, by his subornation,, True
Upon my life, began her devilish practises:, True
Or, if he were not privy to those faults,, True
Yet, by reputing of his high descent,, True
As next the king he was successive heir,, True
And such high vaunts of his nobility,, True
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess, True
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall., True
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;, True
And in his simple show he harbours treason., True
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb., True
No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man, True
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit., True
, True
CARDINAL, True
, True
Did he not, contrary to form of law,, True
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?, True
, True
YORK, True

Levy great sums of money through the realm, True
For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?, True
By means whereof the towns each day revolted., True
, True
BUCKINGHAM, True

My lords, at once: the care you have of us,, True
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,, True
Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,, True
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent, True
From meaning treason to our royal person, True
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:, True
The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given, True
To dream on evil or to work my downfall., True
, True
QUEEN MARGARET, True
, True
Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!, True
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,, True
For he's disposed as the hateful raven:, True
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,, True
For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf., True
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?, True
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all, True
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man., True

YORK, True
, True
[Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France, True
As firmly as I hope for fertile England., True
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud, True

Or sell my title for a glorious grave., True

Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush, True
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:, True
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted., True
The purest spring is not so free from mud, True
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:, True
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?, True
, True
YORK, True

'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,, True

By means whereof his highness hath lost France., True

GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?, True
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,, True
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France., True
So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,, True
Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,, True
That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,, True
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,, True
Be brought against me at my trial-day!, True
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,, True
Because I would not tax the needy commons,, True
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,, True
And never ask'd for restitution., True
, True

, True
I say no more than truth, so help me God!, True

In your protectorship you did devise, True
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,, True
That England was defamed by tyranny., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was, True
protector,, True
Pity was all the fault that was in me;, True
For I should melt at an offender's tears,, True
And lowly words were ransom for their fault., True
Unless it were a bloody murderer,, True
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,, True
I never gave them condign punishment:, True
Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured, True
Above the felon or what trespass else., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:, True
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,, True
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself., True
I do arrest you in his highness' name;, True
And here commit you to my lord cardinal, True
To keep, until your further time of trial., True

My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope, True
That you will clear yourself from all suspect:, True
My conscience tells me you are innocent., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:, True
Virtue is choked with foul ambition, True
And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;, True
Foul subornation is predominant, True
And equity exiled your highness' land., True
I know their complot is to have my life,, True
And if my death might make this island happy,, True
And prove the period of their tyranny,, True
I would expend it with all willingness:, True
But mine is made the prologue to their play;, True
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,, True
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy., True
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,, True
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;, True
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue, True
The envious load that lies upon his heart;, True
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,, True
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,, True
By false accuse doth level at my life:, True
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,, True
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,, True
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up, True
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:, True
Ay, all you have laid your heads together--, True
Myself had notice of your conventicles--, True
And all to make away my guiltless life., True
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,, True
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;, True
The ancient proverb will be well effected:, True

My liege, his railing is intolerable:, True
If those that care to keep your royal person, True
From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage, True

For what's more miserable than discontent?, True
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see, True
The map of honour, truth and loyalty:, True
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come, True
That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith., True
What louring star now envies thy estate,, True
That these great lords and Margaret our queen, True
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?, True
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;, True
And as the butcher takes away the calf, True
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,, True
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,, True
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;, True
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,, True

And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,, True
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case, True
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes, True

With sorrow snares relenting passengers,, True
Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,, True
With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child, True
That for the beauty thinks it excellent., True
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--, True

The commons haply rise, to save his life;, True

Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,, True
To make the fox surveyor of the fold?, True

No; let him die, in that he is a fox,, True
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,, True

As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege., True
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:, True

Faster than spring-time showers comes thought, True
on thought,, True

I fear me you but warm the starved snake,, True

I take it kindly; and yet be well assured, True
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands., True
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,, True
I will stir up in England some black storm, True
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;, True

I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,, True
John Cade of Ashford,, True
To make commotion, as full well he can,, True
Under the title of John Mortimer., True
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade, True
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,, True
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts, True
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;, True
And, in the end being rescued, I have seen, True
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,, True
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells., True
Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,, True
Hath he conversed with the enemy,, True
And undiscover'd come to me again, True
And given me notice of their villanies., True
This devil here shall be my substitute;, True
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,, True
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:, True
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,, True
How they affect the house and claim of York., True
Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,, True
I know no pain they can inflict upon him, True
Will make him say I moved him to those arms., True
Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,, True
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength, True
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;, True

A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,, True

Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath., True

But when I swear, it is irrevocable., True
If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found, True
On any ground that I am ruler of,, True
The world shall not be ransom for thy life., True
Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;, True

A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?, True
Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,, True
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,, True

Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,, True
With full as many signs of deadly hate,, True
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:, True
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;, True
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;, True
Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;, True
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:, True
And even now my burthen'd heart would break,, True
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!, True
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!, True
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!, True

You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?, True

Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,, True
And with the southern clouds contend in tears,, True
Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?, True
Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;, True
If thou be found by me, thou art but dead., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
If I depart from thee, I cannot live;, True
And in thy sight to die, what were it else, True
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?, True
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,, True
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe, True
Dying with mother's dug between its lips:, True
Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,, True
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,, True
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;, True

O, torture me no more! I will confess., True
Alive again? then show me where he is:, True
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him., True
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them., True
Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,, True
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul., True
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary, True

Captain, True
, True
The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day, True
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;, True
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades, True
That drag the tragic melancholy night;, True
Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,, True
Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws, True
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air., True
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;, True
For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,, True
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,, True
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore., True
Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;, True
And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;, True
The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share., True
, True
First Gentleman, True
, True
What is my ransom, master? let me know., True
, True
Master, True
, True
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head., True
Master's-Mate And so much shall you give, or off goes yours., True
, True
Captain, True
, True
What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,, True
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?, True
Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:, True
The lives of those which we have lost in fight, True
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!, True
, True
First Gentleman, True
, True
I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life., True
, True
Second Gentleman, True
, True
And so will I and write home for it straight., True
, True
WHITMORE, True
, True
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,, True
And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;, True

WHITMORE, True
, True
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore., True
How now! why start'st thou? what, doth, True
death affright?, True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death., True
A cunning man did calculate my birth, True
And told me that by water I should die:, True
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;, True
Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded., True
, True
WHITMORE, True
, True
Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:, True
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,, True
But with our sword we wiped away the blot;, True
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,, True
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,, True
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!, True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,, True
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole., True
, True
WHITMORE, True

SUFFOLK, True

Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?, True
, True
Captain, True

But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,, True
The honourable blood of Lancaster,, True
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom., True
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?, True
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule, True
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?, True
How often hast thou waited at my cup,, True
Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board., True
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?, True
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,, True
Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;, True
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood, True
And duly waited for my coming forth?, True
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,, True
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue., True
, True
WHITMORE, True
, True
Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?, True
, True
Captain, True

First let my words stab him, as he hath me., True

SUFFOLK, True
, True
Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou., True

Convey him hence and on our longboat's side, True
Strike off his head., True

, True
Pole!, True
, True
Captain, True
, True
Pool! Sir Pool! lord!, True
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt, True
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks., True
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth, True
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:, True
Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;, True
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,, True
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,, True
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:, True
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,, True
For daring to affy a mighty lord, True
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,, True
Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem., True
By devilish policy art thou grown great,, True
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged, True
With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart., True
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,, True
The false revolting Normans thorough thee, True
Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy, True
Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,, True
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home., True
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,, True
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,, True
As hating thee, are rising up in arms:, True
And now the house of York, thrust from the crown, True
By shameful murder of a guiltless king, True
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,, True
Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours, True
Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,, True
Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.', True
The commons here in Kent are up in arms:, True
And, to conclude, reproach and beggary, True
Is crept into the palace of our king., True
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder, True
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!, True
Small things make base men proud: this villain here,, True
Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more, True
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate., True
Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:, True
It is impossible that I should die, True
By such a lowly vassal as thyself., True
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:, True
I go of message from the queen to France;, True
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel., True

, True
First Gentleman, True
, True
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,, True
Used to command, untaught to plead for favour., True
Far be it we should honour such as these, True
With humble suit: no, rather let my head, True
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any, True
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;, True
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole, True
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom., True
True nobility is exempt from fear:, True
More can I bear than you dare execute., True
, True
Captain, True
, True
Hale him away, and let him talk no more., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,, True
That this my death may never be forgot!, True
Great men oft die by vile bezonians:, True
A Roman sworder and banditto slave, True
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand, True
Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders, True
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates., True
, True
Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk, True
, True
Captain, True
, True
And as for these whose ransom we have set,, True
It is our pleasure one of them depart;, True
Therefore come you with us and let him go., True

There let his head and lifeless body lie,, True
Until the queen his mistress bury it., True

I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress, True
the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it., True

So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it, True

Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen., True

HOLLAND, True

True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;, True
which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be, True
labouring men; and therefore should we be, True
magistrates., True
, True
BEVIS, True

Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a, True
brave mind than a hard hand., True

I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the, True
tanner of Wingham,--, True

thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should, True
be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled, True

had no other books but the score and the tally, thou, True
hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to, True

paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou, True
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and, True
a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian, True
ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed, True
justices of peace, to call poor men before them, True
about matters they were not able to answer., True
Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because, True

And thence discover how with most advantage, True
They may vex us with shot, or with assault., True

The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner, True

For him was I exchanged and ransomed., True
But with a baser man of arms by far, True
Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:, True
Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,, True
Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd., True
In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired., True

To be a public spectacle to all:, True
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,, True
The scarecrow that affrights our children so., True
Then broke I from the officers that led me,, True
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,, True
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:, True
My grisly countenance made others fly;, True
None durst come near for fear of sudden death., True
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;, True
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,, True
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,, True
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:, True
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,, True
That walked about me every minute-while;, True
And if I did but stir out of my bed,, True
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart., True

Enter the Boy with a linstock, True

SALISBURY, True
, True
I grieve to hear what torments you endured,, True

What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?, True
Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:, True
How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?, True
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!, True
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand, True
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!, True
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;, True
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;, True
Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,, True
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field., True
Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,, True
One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:, True
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world., True
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,, True

Thou shalt not die whiles--, True

Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:, True
Wretched shall France be only in my name., True

Now, like to whelps, we crying run away., True

A short alarum, True
Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,, True

It will not be: retire into your trenches:, True

Whose glory fills the world with loud report., True

BURGUNDY, True

Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars, True
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,, True
When ladies crave to be encounter'd with., True
You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit., True
, True
TALBOT, True

Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men, True
Could not prevail with all their oratory,, True
Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:, True
And therefore tell her I return great thanks,, True
And in submission will attend on her., True
Will not your honours bear me company?, True
, True
BEDFORD, True

No, truly; it is more than manners will:, True

Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,, True
I mean to prove this lady's courtesy., True

Madam, it is., True

Is this the scourge of France?, True
Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad, True
That with his name the mothers still their babes?, True
I see report is fabulous and false:, True
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,, True
A second Hector, for his grim aspect,, True
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs., True
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!, True
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp, True

No, no, I am but shadow of myself:, True
You are deceived, my substance is not here;, True
For what you see is but the smallest part, True

I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,, True
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,, True
Your roof were not sufficient to contain't., True
COUNTESS, True

TALBOT, True

That will I show you presently., True

Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers, True
How say you, madam? are you now persuaded, True
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?, True
These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,, True
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,, True
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns, True
And in a moment makes them desolate., True
COUNTESS, True

Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:, True
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited, True

Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue, True
The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake, True

What you have done hath not offended me;, True

Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?, True
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?, True

Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;, True
The garden here is more convenient., True
RICHARD, True

Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;, True
Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?, True

SUFFOLK, True

Faith, I have been a truant in the law,, True

Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us., True

Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;, True
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;, True
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,, True
Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw., True
RICHARD, True

PLANTAGENET, True

Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:, True
The truth appears so naked on my side, True
That any purblind eye may find it out., True

SOMERSET, True

And on my side it is so well apparell'd,, True
So clear, so shining and so evident, True
That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye., True
RICHARD, True

I love no colours, and without all colour, True
Of base insinuating flattery, True
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet., True

Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,, True
Till you conclude that he upon whose side, True
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree, True

Then for the truth and plainness of the case., True
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,, True
Giving my verdict on the white rose side., True

SOMERSET, True

Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,, True
Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red, True

If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,, True
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt, True

Now, Somerset, where is your argument?, True

Here in my scabbard, meditating that, True
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red., True
RICHARD, True

For pale they look with fear, as witnessing, True
The truth on our side., True

SOMERSET, True

No, Plantagenet,, True
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks, True

Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,, True
That shall maintain what I have said is true,, True
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen., True

By him that made me, I'll maintain my words, True
On any plot of ground in Christendom., True
Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,, True
For treason executed in our late king's days?, True
And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,, True

His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;, True

RICHARD, True

My father was attached, not attainted,, True

Will I upon thy party wear this rose:, True
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,, True

MORTIMER, True
, True
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,, True
Let dying Mortimer here rest himself., True
Even like a man new haled from the rack,, True
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment., True
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,, True
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,, True
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer., True
These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,, True
Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;, True
Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,, True
And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine, True
That droops his sapless branches to the ground;, True
Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,, True
Unable to support this lump of clay,, True
Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,, True
As witting I no other comfort have., True
But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?, True
, True
First Gaoler, True
, True
Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:, True
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;, True
And answer was return'd that he will come., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied., True
Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine., True
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,, True
Before whose glory I was great in arms,, True
This loathsome sequestration have I had:, True
And even since then hath Richard been obscured,, True
Deprived of honour and inheritance., True
But now the arbitrator of despairs,, True
Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,, True
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:, True
I would his troubles likewise were expired,, True
That so he might recover what was lost., True

Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes., True

MORTIMER, True
, True
Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,, True
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:, True
O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,, True
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss., True
And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,, True
Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?, True
RICHARD, True
, True
PLANTAGENET, True
, True
First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;, True
And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease., True
This day, in argument upon a case,, True
Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;, True
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue, True
And did upbraid me with my father's death:, True
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,, True
Else with the like I had requited him., True
Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,, True
In honour of a true Plantagenet, True
And for alliance sake, declare the cause, True
My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me, True
And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth, True
Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,, True
Was cursed instrument of his decease., True
RICHARD, True
, True
PLANTAGENET, True
, True
Discover more at large what cause that was,, True
For I am ignorant and cannot guess., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
I will, if that my fading breath permit, True
And death approach not ere my tale be done., True
Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,, True
Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,, True
The first-begotten and the lawful heir,, True
Of Edward king, the third of that descent:, True
During whose reign the Percies of the north,, True
Finding his usurpation most unjust,, True
Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:, True
The reason moved these warlike lords to this, True
Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,, True
Leaving no heir begotten of his body--, True
I was the next by birth and parentage;, True
For by my mother I derived am, True
From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son, True
To King Edward the Third; whereas he, True
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,, True
Being but fourth of that heroic line., True
But mark: as in this haughty attempt, True
They laboured to plant the rightful heir,, True
I lost my liberty and they their lives., True
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,, True
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,, True
Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived, True
From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,, True
Marrying my sister that thy mother was,, True
Again in pity of my hard distress, True
Levied an army, weening to redeem, True
And have install'd me in the diadem:, True
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl, True
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,, True
In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd., True
RICHARD, True
, True
PLANTAGENET, True
, True
Of which, my lord, your honour is the last., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
True; and thou seest that I no issue have, True
And that my fainting words do warrant death;, True
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:, True
But yet be wary in thy studious care., True
RICHARD, True
, True
PLANTAGENET, True
, True
Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:, True
But yet, methinks, my father's execution, True
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny., True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
With silence, nephew, be thou politic:, True
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,, True
And like a mountain, not to be removed., True
But now thy uncle is removing hence:, True
As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd, True
With long continuance in a settled place., True
RICHARD, True
, True
PLANTAGENET, True
, True
O, uncle, would some part of my young years, True
Might but redeem the passage of your age!, True
, True
MORTIMER, True
, True
Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth, True
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill., True
Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;, True
Only give order for my funeral:, True
And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes, True
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!, True
, True
Dies, True
RICHARD, True
, True
PLANTAGENET, True
, True
And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!, True
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage, True
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days., True
Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;, True
And what I do imagine let that rest., True
Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself, True
Will see his burial better than his life., True
, True
Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER, True
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,, True
Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:, True
And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,, True
Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:, True
I doubt not but with honour to redress;, True
And therefore haste I to the parliament,, True
Either to be restored to my blood,, True
Or make my ill the advantage of my good., True

Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:, True
No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,, True
Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,, True

Thou art a most pernicious usurer,, True
Forward by nature, enemy to peace;, True
Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems, True

King Henry's peers and chief nobility, True
Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!, True
O, think upon the conquest of my father,, True

That any one should therefore be suspicious, True
I more incline to Somerset than York:, True
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:, True

KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,, True
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:, True
Her virtues graced with external gifts, True
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:, True
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts, True
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,, True
So am I driven by breath of her renown, True
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive, True
Where I may have fruition of her love., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale, True
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;, True
The chief perfections of that lovely dame, True
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,, True
Would make a volume of enticing lines,, True
Able to ravish any dull conceit:, True
And, which is more, she is not so divine,, True
So full-replete with choice of all delights,, True
But with as humble lowliness of mind, True
She is content to be at your command;, True
Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,, True
To love and honour Henry as her lord., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume., True
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent, True
That Margaret may be England's royal queen., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
So should I give consent to flatter sin., True
You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd, True
Unto another lady of esteem:, True
How shall we then dispense with that contract,, True
And not deface your honour with reproach?, True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;, True
Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd, True
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists, True
By reason of his adversary's odds:, True
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,, True
And therefore may be broke without offence., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?, True
Her father is no better than an earl,, True
Although in glorious titles he excel., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
Yes, lord, her father is a king,, True
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;, True
And of such great authority in France, True
As his alliance will confirm our peace, True
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance., True
, True
GLOUCESTER, True
, True
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,, True
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles., True
, True
EXETER, True
, True
Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,, True
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give., True
, True
SUFFOLK, True
, True
A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,, True
That he should be so abject, base and poor,, True
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love., True
Henry is able to enrich his queen, True
And not seek a queen to make him rich:, True
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,, True
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse., True
Marriage is a matter of more worth, True
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;, True
Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,, True
Must be companion of his nuptial bed:, True
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,, True
It most of all these reasons bindeth us,, True
In our opinions she should be preferr'd., True
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,, True
An age of discord and continual strife?, True
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,, True
And is a pattern of celestial peace., True
Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,, True
But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?, True
Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,, True
Approves her fit for none but for a king:, True
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,, True
More than in women commonly is seen,, True
Will answer our hope in issue of a king;, True
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,, True
Is likely to beget more conquerors,, True
If with a lady of so high resolve, True
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love., True
Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me, True
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she., True
, True
KING HENRY VI, True
, True
Whether it be through force of your report,, True
My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that, True
My tender youth was never yet attaint, True
With any passion of inflaming love,, True
I cannot tell; but this I am assured,, True
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,, True
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,, True
As I am sick with working of my thoughts., True
Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;, True
Agree to any covenants, and procure, True
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come, True
To cross the seas to England and be crown'd, True
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:, True
For your expenses and sufficient charge,, True
Among the people gather up a tenth., True
Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,, True
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares., True
And you, good uncle, banish all offence:, True
If you do censure me by what you were,, True
Not what you are, I know it will excuse, True
This sudden execution of my will., True
And so, conduct me where, from company,, True
I may revolve and ruminate my grief., True
, True
Exit, True

GLOUCESTER, True
, True
Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last., True

Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER, True

SUFFOLK, True
, True
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,, True
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,, True
With hope to find the like event in love,, True
But prosper better than the Trojan did., True
Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;, True
But I will rule both her, the king and realm., True
