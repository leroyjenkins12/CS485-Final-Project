Oh Lorraine say what mean our men to fly,
Our number is far greater than our foes,
The garrison of Genoese my lord,
That came from Paris weary with their march,
Grudging to be suddenly employed,
No sooner in the forefront took their place,
But straight retiring so dismayed the rest,
As likewise they betook themselves to flight,
In which for haste to make a safe escape,
More in the clustering throng are pressed to death,
Than by the enemy a thousandfold,
 hapless fortune Let us yet assay,
If we can counsel some of them to stay,
Lord Audley whiles our son is in the chase,
Withdraw our powers unto this little hill,
And here a season let us breathe ourselves,
Justdooming heaven whose secret providence,
To our gross judgement is inscrutable,
How are we bound to praise thy wondrous works,
That hast this day given way unto the right,
And made the wicked stumble at themselves,
Rescue King Edward rescue for thy son,
Rescue Artois What is he prisoner,
Or by violence fell beside his horse,
Neither my lord but narrowly beset,
With turning Frenchmen whom he did pursue,
As tis impossible that he should scape,
Except your highness presently descend,
Tut let him fight we gave him arms today,
And he is laboring for a knighthood man,
The Prince my lord the Prince Oh succor him,
Hes close encompassed with a world of odds,
Then will he win a world of honor too,
If he by valor can redeem him thence,
If not what remedy We have more sons,
Than one to comfort our declining age,
Renownèd Edward give me leave  pray,
To lead my soldiers where  may relieve,
Your graces son in danger to be slain,
The snares of French like emmets on a bank,
Muster about him whilst he lionlike,
Entangled in the net of their assaults,
Franticly rends and bites the woven toil,
But all in vain he cannot free himself,
Audley content  will not have a man,
On pain of death sent forth to succor him,
This is the day ordained by destiny,
To season his courage with those grievous thoughts,
That if he breaketh out Nestors years on earth,
Will make him savor still of this exploit,
Ah but he shall not live to see those days,
Why then his epitaph is lasting praise,
Yet good my lord tis too much willfulness,
To let his blood be spilt that may be saved,
Exclaim no more for none of you can tell,
Whether a borrowed aid will serve or no,
Perhaps he is already slain or taen,
And dare a falcon when shes in her flight,
And ever after shell be haggardlike,
Let Edward be delivered by our hands,
And still in danger hell expect the like,
But if himself himself redeem from thence,
He will have vanquished cheerful death and fear,
And ever after dread their force no more,
Than if they were but babes or captive slaves,
 cruel father Farewell Edward then,
Farewell sweet prince the hope of chivalry,
Oh would my life might ransom him from death,
The dismal charge of trumpets loud retreat,
All are not slain  hope that went with him,
Some will return with tidings good or bad,
Enter Prince Edward in triumph bearing in his hand his shivered lance and the body of the King of Bohemia born before,
wrapped in the colors They run and embrace him,
Oh joyful sight  victorious Edward lives,
Prince Edward kneels and kisses his fathers hand,
First having done my duty as beseemed,
Lords  regreet you all with hearty thanks,
And now behold after my winters toil,
My painful voyage on the boistrous sea,
Of wars devouring gulfs and steely rocks,
 bring my fraught unto the wishèd port,
My summers hope my travels sweet reward,
And here with humble duty  present,
This sacrifice this first fruit of my sword,
Cropped and cut down even at the gate of death,
The King of Boheme father whom  slew,
Whose thousands had entrenched me round about,
And lay as thick upon my battered crest,
As on an anvil with their ponderous glaives,
Yet marble courage still did underprop,
And when my weary arms with often blows,
Like the continual laboring woodmans axe,
That is enjoined to fell a load of oaks,
Began to falter straight  would recover,
My gifts you gave me and my zealous vow,
And then new courage made me fresh again,
That in despite  carved my passage forth,
And put the multitude to speedy flight,
Prince Edwards sword born by a soldier,
Lo thus hath Edwards hand filled your request,
And done  hope the duty of a knight,
Ay well thou hast deserved a knighthood Ned,
And therefore with thy sword yet reeking warm,
With blood of those that fought to be thy bane,
Arise Prince Edward trusty knight at arms,
This day thou hast confounded me with joy,
And proved thyself fit heir unto a king,
Here is a note my gracious lord of those,
That in this conflict of our foes were slain,
Eleven princes of esteem fourscore barons,
 hundred and twenty knights and thirty thousand,
Common soldiers and of our men a thousand,
Our God be praised Now John of France  hope,
Thou knowst King Edward for no wantonness,
No lovesick cockney nor his soldiers jades,
But which way is the fearful king escaped,
Towards Poitiers noble father  and his sons,
Ned thou and Audley shall pursue them still,
Myself and Derby will to Calais straight,
And there begirt that haven town with siege,
Now lies it on an upshot therefore strike,
And wistly follow whiles the games on foot,
Wounding her bosom with her crookèd beak,
That so her nest of young ones might be fed,
With drops of blood that issue from her heart,
The motto Sic et vos And so should you,
