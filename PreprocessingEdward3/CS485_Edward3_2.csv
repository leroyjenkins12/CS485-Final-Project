Alas how much in vain my poor eyes gaze,
For succor that my sovereign should send,
Ah cousin Montague  fear thou wants,
The lively spirit sharply to solicit,
With vehement suit the King in my behalf,
Thou dost not tell him what a grief it is,
To be the scornful captive to a Scot,
Either to be wooed with broad untunèd oaths,
Or forced by rough insulting barbarism,
Thou dost not tell him if he here prevail,
How much they will deride us in the North,
And in their vile uncivil skipping jigs,
Bray forth their conquest and our overthrow,
Even in the barren bleak and fruitless air,
Enter King David Douglas and Lorraine below,
 must withdraw the everlasting foe,
Comes to the wall Ill closely step aside,
And list their babble blunt and full of pride,
My lord of Lorraine to our brother of France,
Commend us as the man in Christendom,
That we most reverence and entirely love,
Touching your embassage return and say,
That we with England will not enter parley,
Nor never make fair weather or take truce,
But burn their neighbor towns and so persist,
With eager rods beyond their city York,
And never shall our bonny riders rest,
Nor rusting canker have the time to eat,
Their lightborne snaffles nor their nimble spurs,
Nor lay aside their jacks of gimmaled mail,
Nor hang their staves of grainèd Scottish ash,
In peaceful wise upon their city walls,
Nor from their buttoned tawny leathern belts,
Dismiss their biting whinyards till your king,
Cry out Enough spare England now for pity,
Farewell and tell him that you leave us here,
Before this castle say you came from us,
Even when we had that yielded to our hands,
 take my leave and fairly will return,
Your acceptable greeting to my king,
Now Douglas to our former task again,
For the division of this certain spoil,
My liege  crave the lady and no more,
Nay soft ye sir first  must make my choice,
And first  do bespeak her for myself,
Why then my liege let me enjoy her jewels,
Those are her own still liable to her,
And who inherits her hath those with all,
Enter a Scot as messenger in haste,
My liege as we were pricking on the hills,
To fetch in booty marching hitherward,
We might descry a mighty host of men,
The sun reflecting on the armor showed,
 field of plate a wood of picks advanced,
Bethink your highness speedily herein,
An easy march within four hours will bring,
The hindmost rank unto this place my liege,
Dislodge dislodge it is the King of England,
Jemmy my man saddle my bonny black,
Meanst thou to fight Douglas We are too weak,
 know it well my liege and therefore fly,
My lords of Scotland will ye stay and drink,
She mocks at us Douglas  cannot endure it,
Say good my lord which is he must have the lady,
And which her jewels  am sure my lords,
Ye will not hence till you have shared the spoils,
She heard the messenger and heard our talk,
And now that comfort makes her scorn at us,
Arm my good lord Oh we are all surprised,
After the French ambassador my liege,
And tell him that you dare not ride to York,
Excuse it that your bonny horse is lame,
She heard that too intolerable grief,
Woman farewell Although  do not stay ,
Tis not for fear  and yet you run away,
 happy comfort welcome to our house,
The confident and boistrous boasting Scot,
That swore before my walls they would not back,
For all the armèd power of this land,
With faceless fear that ever turns his back,
Turned hence again the blasting northeast wind,
Upon the bare report and name of arms,
 summers day see where my cousin comes,
How fares my aunt We are not Scots,
Why do you shut your gates against your friends,
Well may  give a welcome cousin to thee,
For thou comst well to chase my foes from hence,
The King himself is come in person hither,
Dear aunt descend and gratulate his highness,
How may  entertain his majesty,
To show my duty and his dignity,
Enter King Edward Warwick Artois with others,
What are the stealing foxes fled and gone,
Before we could uncouple at their heels,
They are my liege but with a cheerful cry,
Hot hounds and hardy chase them at the heels,
This is the Countess Warwick is it not,
Even she my liege whose beauty tyrants fear,
As a May blossom with pernicious winds,
Hath sullied withered overcast and done,
Hath she been fairer Warwick than she is,
My gracious king fair is she not at all,
If that her self were by to stain herself,
As  have seen her when she was her self,
What strange enchantment lurked in those her eyes,
When they excelled this excellence they have,
That now her dim decline hath power to draw,
My subject eyes from piercing majesty,
To gaze on her with doting admiration,
In duty lower than the ground  kneel,
And for my dull knees bow my feeling heart,
To witness my obedience to your highness,
With many millions of a subjects thanks,
For this your royal presence whose approach,
Hath driven war and danger from my gate,
Lady stand up  come to bring thee peace,
However thereby  have purchased war,
No war to you my liege the Scots are gone,
And gallop home toward Scotland with their hate,
Aside Lest yielding here  pine in shameful love ,
To them Come well pursue the Scots Artois away,
 little while my gracious sovereign stay,
And let the power of a mighty king,
Honor our roof my husband in the wars,
When he shall hear it will triumph for joy,
Then dear my liege now niggard not thy state,
Being at the wall enter our homely gate,
Pardon me Countess  will come no near,
 dreamed tonight of treason and  fear,
Far from this place let ugly treason lie,
Aside No farther off than her conspiring eye,
Which shoots infected poison in my heart,
Beyond repulse of wit or cure of art,
Now in the sun alone it doth not lie,
With light to take light from a mortal eye,
For here two daystars that mine eyes would see,
More than the sun steals mine own light from me,
Contemplative desire desire to be,
In contemplation that may master thee ,
To them Warwick Artois to horse and lets away,
What might  speak to make my sovereign stay,
Aside What needs a tongue to such a speaking eye,
That more persuades then winning oratory,
Let not thy presence like the April sun,
Flatter our earth and suddenly be done,
More happy do not make our outward wall,
Than thou wilt grace our inner house withal,
Our house my liege is like a country swain,
Whose habit rude and manners blunt and plain,
Presageth nought yet inly beautified,
With bountys riches and fair hidden pride,
For where the golden ore doth buried lie,
The ground undecked with natures tapestry,
Seems barren sere unfertile fruitless dry,
And where the upper turf of earth doth boast,
His pride perfumes and particolored cost,
Delve there and find this issue and their pride,
To spring from ordure and corruptions side,
But to make up my all too long compare,
These ragged walls no testimony are,
What is within but like a cloak doth hide,
From weathers waste the undergarnished pride,
More gracious than my terms can let thee be,
Entreat thyself to stay a while with me,
As wise as fair  what fond fit can be heard,
When wisdom keeps the gate as beautys guard ,
Countess albeit my business urgeth me,
It shall attend while  attend on thee,
Come on my lords here will  host tonight,
