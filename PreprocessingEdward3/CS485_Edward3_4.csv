Thrice noble Audley well encountered here,
How is it with our sovereign and his peers,
Tis full a fortnight since  saw his highness,
What time he sent me forth to muster men,
Which  accordingly have done and bring them hither,
In fair array before his majesty,
What news my lord of Derby from the emperor,
As good as we desire the emperor,
Hath yielded to his highness friendly aid,
And makes our king lieutenantgeneral,
In all his lands and large dominions,
Then via for the spacious bounds of France,
What doth his highness leap to hear this news,
 have not yet found time to open them,
The King is in his closet malcontent,
For what  know not but he gave in charge,
Till after dinner none should interrupt him,
The Countess Salisbury and her father Warwick,
Artois and all look underneath the brows,
Undoubtedly then something is amiss,
The trumpets sound  the King is now abroad,
Befall my sovereign all my sovereigns wish,
Ah that thou wert a witch to make it so,
And hath accorded to your highness suit,
Thou liest she hath not but  would she had,
All love and duty to my lord the king,
Well all but one is none  what news with you,
 have my liege levied those horse and foot,
According as your charge and brought them hither,
Then let those foot trudge hence upon those horse,
According to our discharge and be gone ,
Derby Ill look upon the Countess mind anon,
 mean the emperor  leave me alone,
Thus from the hearts abundance speaks the tongue,
Countess for emperor and indeed why not,
She is as imperator over me and  to her,
Am as a kneeling vassal that observes,
The pleasure or displeasure of her eye,
What says the more than Cleopatras match,
What drum is this that thunders forth this march,
To start the tender Cupid in my bosom,
Poor sheepskin how it brawls with him that beateth it,
Go break the thundring parchment bottom out,
And  will teach it to conduct sweet lines,
Unto the bosom of a heavenly nymph,
For  will use it as my writing paper,
And so reduce him from a scolding drum,
To be the herald and dear counselbearer,
Betwixt a goddess and a mighty king,
Go bid the drummer learn to touch the lute,
Or hang him in the braces of his drum,
For now we think it an uncivil thing,
To trouble heaven with such harsh resounds Away ,
The quarrel that  have requires no arms,
But these of mine and these shall meet my foe,
In a deep march of penetrable groans,
My eyes shall be my arrows and my sighs,
Shall serve me as the vantage of the wind,
To whirl away my sweetest artillery,
Ah but alas she wins the sun of me,
For that is she herself and thence it comes,
That poets term the wanton warrior blind,
But love hath eyes as judgement to his steps,
Till too much lovèd glory dazzles them ,
My liege the drum that stroke the lusty march,
Stands with Prince Edward your thrice valiant son,
Aside  see the boy Oh how his mothers face,
Modelled in his corrects my strayed desire,
And rates my heart and chides my thievish eye,
Who being rich enough in seeing her,
Yet seeks elsewhere and basest theft is that,
Which cannot cloak itself on poverty,
To Prince Edward Now boy what news,
 have assembled my dear lord and father,
The choicest buds of all our English blood,
For our affairs to France and here we come,
To take direction from your majesty,
Aside Still do  see in him delineate,
His mothers visage those his eyes are hers,
Who looking wistly on me make me blush,
For faults against themselves give evidence,
Lust is a fire and men like lanthorns show,
Light lust within themselves even through themselves,
Away loose silks of wavering vanity,
Shall the large limit of fair Brittany,
By me be overthrown and shall  not,
Master this little mansion of myself,
Give me an armor of eternal steel,
 go to conquer kings and shall  not then,
Subdue myself and be my enemies friend,
It must not be To Prince Edward Come boy forward advance,
Lets with our colors sweet the air of France,
My liege the Countess with a smiling cheer,
Desires access unto your majesty,
Aside Why there it goes that very smile of hers,
Hath ransomed captive France and set the King,
The Dauphin and the peers at liberty ,
To Prince Edward Go leave me Ned and revel with thy friends,
Thy mother is but black and thou like her,
Dost put it in my mind how foul she is ,
Go fetch the Countess hither in thy hand,
And let her chase away these winter clouds,
For she gives beauty both to heaven and earth,
The sin is more to hack and hew poor men,
Than to embrace in an unlawful bed,
Since leathern Adam till this youngest hour,
Enter Lodowick with the Countess,
Go Lodwick put thy hand into thy purse,
Play spend give riot waste do what thou wilt,
So thou wilt hence a while and leave me here,
Now my souls playfellow art thou come,
To speak the more than heavenly word of yea,
To my objection in thy beauteous love,
My father on his blessing hath commanded ,
And that my dearest love can be no less,
Than right for right and render love for love,
Than wrong for wrong and endless hate for hate,
But sith  see your majesty so bent,
That my unwillingness my husbands love,
Your high estate nor no respect respected,
Can be my help but that your mightiness,
Will overbear and awe these dear regards,
 bind my discontent to my content,
And what  would not Ill compel  will,
Provided that yourself remove those lets,
That stand between your highness love and mine,
Name them fair Countess and by heaven  will,
It is their lives that stand between our love,
That  would have choked up my sovereign,
Your queen and Salisbury my wedded husband,
Who living have that title in our love,
That we cannot bestow but by their death,
Thy opposition is beyond our law,
Can hinder you to execute the one,
Let it forbid you to attempt the other,
 cannot think you love me as you say,
Unless you do make good what you have sworn,
No more thy husband and the queen shall die,
Fairer thou art by far than Hero was,
Beardless Leander not so strong as ,
He swum an easy current for his love,
But  will through a Hellespont of blood,
To arrive at Sestos where my Hero lies,
Nay youll do more youll make the river too,
With their heart bloods that keep our love asunder,
Of which my husband and your wife are twain,
Thy beauty makes them guilty of their death,
And gives in evidence that they shall die,
Upon which verdict  their judge condemn them,
 perjured beauty more corrupted judge,
When to the great Star Chamber oer our heads,
The universal sessions calls to count,
This packing evil we both shall tremble for it,
What says my fair love Is she resolute,
Resolute to be dissolved and therefore this,
Keep but thy word great king and  am thine,
Stand where thou dost Ill part a little from thee,
And see how  will yield me to thy hands,
Here by my side doth hang my wedding knives,
Take thou the one and with it kill thy queen,
And learn by me to find her where she lies,
And with this other Ill dispatch my love,
Which now lies fast asleep within my heart,
When they are gone then Ill consent to love,
Stir not lascivious king to hinder me,
My resolution is more nimbler far,
Than thy prevention can be in my rescue,
And if thou stir  strike therefore stand still,
And hear the choice that  will put thee to,
Either swear to leave thy most unholy suit,
And never henceforth to solicit me,
Or else by heaven this sharppointed knife,
Shall stain thy earth with that which thou wouldst stain,
My poor chaste blood Swear Edward swear,
Or  will strike and die before thee here,
Even by that power  swear that gives me now,
The power to be ashamèd of myself,
 never mean to part my lips again,
In any words that tends to such a suit,
Arise true English lady whom our isle,
May better boast of than ever Roman might,
Of her whose ransacked treasury hath tasked,
The vain endeavor of so many pens,
Arise and be my fault thy honors fame,
Which after ages shall enrich thee with,
 am awakèd from this idle dream ,
Warwick my son Derby Artois and Audley,
Brave warriors all where are you all this while,
Warwick  make thee Warden of the North,
Thou Prince of Wales and Audley straight to sea,
Scour to Newhaven  some there stay for me,
Myself Artois and Derby will through Flanders,
To greet our friends there and to crave their aid,
This night will scarce suffice me to discover,
My follys siege against a faithful lover,
For ere the sun shall gild the eastern sky,
Well wake him with our martial harmony,
