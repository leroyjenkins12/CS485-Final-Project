Since they refuse our proffered league my lord,
And will not ope their gates and let us in,
We will entrench ourselves on every side,
That neither victuals nor supply of men,
May come to succor this accursèd town,
Famine shall combat where our swords are stopped,
The promised aid that made them stand aloof,
Is now retired and gone another way,
It will repent them of their stubborn will ,
But what are these poor ragged slaves my lord,
Ask what they are it seems they come from,
You wretched patterns of despair and woe,
What are you living men or gliding ghosts,
Crept from your graves to walk upon the earth,
No ghosts my lord but men that breathe a life,
Far worse than is the quiet sleep of death,
We are distressèd poor inhabitants,
That long have been diseasèd sick and lame,
And now because we are not fit to serve,
The captain of the town hath thrust us forth,
That so expense of victuals may be saved,
 charitable deed no doubt and worthy praise,
But how do you imagine then to speed,
We are your enemies in such a case,
We can no less but put ye to the sword,
Since when we proffered truce it was refused,
And if your grace no otherwise vouchsafe,
As welcome death is unto us as life,
Poor silly men much wronged and more distressed,
Go Derby go and see they be relieved,
Command that victuals be appointed them,
And give to every one five crowns apiece,
The lion scorns to touch the yielding prey,
And Edwards sword must fresh itself in such,
As wilful stubbornness hath made perverse,
Lord Percy welcome Whats the news in England,
The Queen my lord comes here to your grace,
And from her highness and the lord vicegerent,
 bring this happy tidings of success,
David of Scotland lately up in arms,
Thinking belike he soonest should prevail,
Your highness being absent from the realm,
Is by the fruitful service of your peers ,
And painful travail of the Queen herself,
That big with child was every day in arms ,
Vanquished subdued and taken prisoner,
Thanks Percy for thy news with all my heart,
What was he took him prisoner in the field,
 squire my lord John Copland is his name,
Who since entreated by her majesty,
Denies to make surrender of his prize,
To any but unto your grace alone,
Whereat the Queen is grievously displeased,
Well then well have a pursuivant dispatched,
To summon Copland hither out of hand,
And with him he shall bring his prisoner king,
The Queens my lord herself by this at sea,
And purposeth as soon as wind will serve,
To land at Calais and to visit you,
She shall be welcome and to wait her coming,
Ill pitch my tent near to the sandy shore,
The burgesses of Calais mighty king,
Have by a counsel willingly decreed,
To yield the town and castle to your hands,
Upon condition it will please your grace,
To grant them benefit of life and goods,
They will so Then belike they may command,
Dispose elect and govern as they list,
No sirrah tell them since they did refuse,
Our princely clemency at first proclaimed,
They shall not have it now although they would,
 will accept of naught but fire and sword,
Except within these two days six of them,
That are the wealthiest merchants in the town,
Come naked all but for their linen shirts,
With each a halter hanged about his neck,
And prostrate yield themselves upon their knees,
To be afflicted hanged or what  please,
And so you may inform their masterships,
Why this it is to trust a broken staff,
Had we not been persuaded John our king,
Would with his army have relieved the town,
We had not stood upon defiance so,
But now tis past that no man can recall,
And better some do go to wrack than all,
