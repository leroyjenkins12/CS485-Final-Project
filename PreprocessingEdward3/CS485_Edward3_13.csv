 sudden darkness hath defaced the sky,
The winds are crept into their caves for fear,
The leaves move not the world is hushed and still,
The birds cease singing and the wandring brooks,
Murmur no wonted greeting to their shores,
Silence attends some wonder and expecteth,
That heaven should pronounce some prophecy,
Where or from whom proceeds this silence Charles,
Our men with open mouths and staring eyes,
Look on each other as they did attend,
Each others words and yet no creature speaks,
 tonguetied fear hath made a midnight hour,
And speeches sleep through all the waking regions,
But now the pompous sun in all his pride,
Looked through his golden coach upon the world,
And on a sudden hath he hid himself,
That now the under earth is as a grave,
Dark deadly silent and uncomfortable,
Hark what a deadly outcry do  hear,
What fearful words are those thy looks presage,
Coward what flight Thou liest  there needs no flight,
Awake thy craven powers and tell on,
The substance of that very fear indeed,
Which is so ghastly printed in thy face,
Do croak and hover oer our soldiers heads,
And keep in triangles and cornered squares,
Right as our forces are embattled,
With their approach there came this sudden fog,
Which now hath hid the airy flower of heaven,
And made at noon a night unnatural,
Upon the quaking and dismayèd world,
In brief our soldiers have let fall their arms,
And stand like metamorphosed images,
Bloodless and pale one gazing on another,
Ay now  call to mind the prophecy,
But  must give no entrance to a fear,
Return and hearten up these yielding souls,
Tell them the ravens seeing them in arms ,
So many fair against a famished few ,
Come but to dine upon their handiwork,
And prey upon the carrion that they kill,
For when we see a horse laid down to die,
Although not dead the ravenous birds,
Sit watching the departure of his life,
Even so these ravens for the carcasses,
Of those poor English that are marked to die,
Hover about and if they cry to us,
Tis but for meat that we must kill for them,
Away and comfort up my soldiers,
And sound the trumpets and at once dispatch,
This little business of a silly fraud,
Another noise Salisbury brought in by a,
Behold my liege this knight and forty more,
Of whom the better part are slain and fled,
With all endeavor sought to break our ranks,
And make their way to the encompassed Prince,
Dispose of him as please your majesty,
Go and the next bough soldier that thou seest,
Disgrace it with his body presently,
For  do hold a tree in France too good,
To be the gallows of an English thief,
My lord of Normandy  have your pass,
And warrant for my safety through this land,
Villiers procured it for thee did he not,
And it is current thou shalt freely pass,
Ay freely to the gallows to be hanged,
 hope your highness will not so disgrace me,
And dash the virtue of my seal at arms,
He hath my neverbroken name to show,
Charactred with this princely hand of mine,
And rather let me leave to be a prince,
Than break the stable verdict of a prince,
 do beseech you let him pass in quiet,
Thou and thy word lie both in my command,
What canst thou promise that  cannot break,
Which of these twain is greater infamy,
To disobey thy father or thy self,
Thy word nor no mans may exceed his power,
Nor that same man doth never break his word,
That keeps it to the utmost of his power,
The breach of faith dwells in the souls consent,
Which if thyself without consent do break,
Thou art not chargèd with the breach of faith,
Go hang him for thy licence lies in me,
And my constraint stands the excuse for thee,
What am  not a soldier in my word,
Then arms adieu and let them fight that list,
Shall  not give my girdle from my waist,
But with a guardian  shall be controlled,
To say  may not give my things away,
Upon my soul had Edward Prince of Wales,
Engaged his word writ down his noble hand,
For all your knights to pass his fathers land,
The royal King to grace his warlike son,
Would not alone safe conduct give to them,
But with all bounty feasted them and theirs,
Dwellst thou on precedents Then be it so,
Say Englishman of what degree thou art,
An earl in England though a prisoner here,
And those that know me call me Salisbury,
Then Salisbury say whither thou art bound,
To Calais where my liege King Edward is,
To Calais Salisbury Then to Calais pack,
And bid the King prepare a noble grave,
To put his princely son black Edward in,
And as thou travelst westward from this place,
Some two leagues hence there is a lofty hill,
Whose top seems topless for the embracing sky,
Doth hide his high head in her azure bosom,
Upon whose tall top when thy foot attains,
Look back upon the humble vale beneath,
Humble of late but now made proud with arms,
And thence behold the wretched Prince of Wales,
Hooped with a bond of iron round about,
After which sight to Calais spur amain,
And say the Prince was smothered and not slain,
And tell the King this is not all his ill,
For  will greet him ere he thinks  will,
Away be gone The smoke but of our shot,
Will choke our foes though bullets hit them not,
