Enter Lord Mountford with a coronet in his hand with him,
My lord of Salisbury since by your aid,
Mine enemy Sir Charles of Blois is slain,
And  again am quietly possessed,
In Brittanys dukedom know that  resolve,
For this kind furtherance of your king and you,
To swear allegiance to his majesty,
In sign whereof receive this coronet,
Bear it unto him and withal mine oath,
Never to be but Edwards faithful friend,
 take it Mountford thus  hope ere long,
The whole dominions of the realm of France,
Will be surrendered to his conquering hand,
Now if  knew but safely how to pass,
 would at Calais gladly meet his grace,
Whither  am by letters certified,
That he intends to have his host removed,
It shall be so this policy will serve ,
Ho whos within Bring Villiers to me,
Villiers thou knowst thou art my prisoner,
And that  might for ransom if  would,
Require of thee a hundred thousand francs,
Or else retain and keep thee captive still,
But so it is that for a smaller charge,
Thou mayst be quit and if thou wilt thyself,
And this it is procure me but a passport,
Of Charles the Duke of Normandy that ,
Without restraint may have recourse to Calais,
Through all the countries where he hath to do ,
Which thou mayst easily obtain  think,
By reason  have often heard thee say,
He and thou were students once together,
And then thou shalt be set at liberty,
How sayst thou Wilt thou undertake to do it,
 will my lord but  must speak with him,
Why so thou shalt Take horse and post from hence,
Only before thou gost swear by thy faith,
That if thou canst not compass my desire,
Thou wilt return my prisoner back again,
And that shall be sufficient warrant for me,
To that condition  agree my lord,
And will unfeignedly perform the same,
Thus once  mean to try a Frenchmans faith,
