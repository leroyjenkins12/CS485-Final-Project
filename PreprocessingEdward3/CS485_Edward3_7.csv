Wheres the Frenchman by whose cunning guide,
We found the shallow of this River Somme,
And had direction how to pass the sea,
How art thou called Tell me thy name,
Gobin de Grace if please your excellence,
Then Gobin for the service thou hast done,
We here enlarge and give thee liberty,
And for recompense beside this good,
Thou shalt receive five hundred marks in gold ,
 know not how we should have met our son,
Whom now in heart  wish  might behold,
Good news my lord the prince is hard at hand,
And with him comes Lord Audley and the rest,
Whom since our landing we could never meet,
Enter Prince Edward Lord Audley and soldiers,
Welcome fair prince how hast thou sped my son,
Since thy arrival on the coast of France,
Successfully  thank the gracious heavens,
Some of their strongest cities we have won,
As Barfleur ô Crotoy and Carentan,
And others wasted leaving at our heels,
 wide apparent field and beaten path,
For solitariness to progress in,
Yet those that would submit we kindly pardoned,
For who in scorn refused our proffered peace,
Endured the penalty of sharp revenge,
Ah France why shouldst thou be this obstinate,
Against the kind embracement of thy friends,
How gently had we thought to touch thy breast,
And set our foot upon thy tender mould,
But that in froward and disdainful pride,
Thou like a skittish and untamèd colt,
Dost start aside and strike us with thy heels,
But tell me Ned in all thy warlike course,
Hast thou not seen the usurping King of France,
Yes my good lord and not two hours ago,
With full a hundred thousand fighting men,
Upon the one side of the rivers bank,
And on the other both his multitudes,
 feared he would have cropped our smaller power,
But happily perceiving your approach,
He hath withdrawn himself to Crécy plains,
Where as it seemeth by his good array,
He means to bid us battle presently,
He shall be welcome  thats the thing we crave,
Enter King John Prince Charles Duke of Normandy Lorraine King of,
Bohemia young Prince Philip and soldiers,
Edward know that John the true King of France,
Musing thou shouldst encroach upon his land,
And in thy tyrannous proceeding slay,
His faithful subjects and subvert his towns,
Spits in thy face and in this manner following,
Upbraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion,
First  condemn thee for a fugitive,
 thievish pirate and a needy mate ,
One that hath either no abiding place,
Or else inhabiting some barren soil,
Where neither herb or fruitful grain is had,
Dost altogether live by pilfering,
Next insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,
Broke league and solemn covenant made with me,
 hold thee for a false pernicious wretch,
And last of all although  scorn to cope,
With one so much inferior to myself,
Yet in respect thy thirst is all for gold,
Thy labor rather to be feared than loved,
To satisfy thy lust in either part,
Here am  come and with me have  brought,
Exceeding store of treasure pearl and coin,
Leave therefore now to persecute the weak,
And armèd entring conflict with the armed,
Let it be seen mongst other petty thefts,
How thou canst win this pillage manfully,
If gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,
Then is thy salutation honeysweet,
But as the one hath no such property,
So is the other most satirical,
Yet wot how  regard thy worthless taunts,
If thou have uttered them to foil my fame,
Or dim the reputation of my birth,
Know that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt,
If slyly to insinuate with the world,
And with a strumpets artificial line,
To paint thy vicious and deformèd cause,
Be well assured the counterfeit will fade,
And in the end thy foul defects be seen,
But if thou didst it to provoke me on,
As who should say  were but timorous,
Or coldly negligent did need a spur,
Bethink thyself how slack  was at sea,
Now since my landing  have won no towns,
Entered no further but upon the coast,
And there have ever since securely slept,
But if  have been otherwise employed,
Imagine Valois whether  intend,
To skirmish not for pillage but for the crown,
Which thou dost wear and that  vow to have,
Or one of us shall fall into his grave,
Look not for cross invectives at our hands,
Or railing execrations of despite,
Let creeping serpents hid in hollow banks,
Sting with their tongues we have remorseless swords,
And they shall plead for us and our affairs,
Yet thus much briefly by my fathers leave,
As all the immodest poison of thy throat,
Is scandalous and most notorious lies,
And our pretended quarrel is truly just,
So end the battle when we meet today ,
May either of us prosper and prevail,
Or luckless cursed receive eternal shame,
That needs no further question and  know,
His conscience witnesseth it is my right,
Therefore Valois say wilt thou yet resign,
Before the sickles thrust into the corn,
Or that enkindled fury turn to flame,
Edward  know what right thou hast in France,
And ere  basely will resign my crown,
This champion field shall be a pool of blood,
And all our prospect as a slaughterhouse,
Ay that approves thee tyrant what thou art,
No father king or shepherd of thy realm,
But one that tears her entrails with thy hands,
And like a thirsty tiger suckst her blood,
You peers of France why do you follow him,
That is so prodigal to spend your lives,
Whom should they follow agèd impotent,
But he that is their trueborn sovereign,
Upbraidst thou him because within his face,
Time hath engraved deep characters of age,
Know that these grave scholars of experience,
Like stiffgrown oaks will stand immovable,
When whirlwind quickly turns up younger trees,
Was ever any of thy fathers house,
but thyself before this present time,
Edwards great lineage by the mothers side,
Five hundred years hath held the sceptre up,
Judge then conspirators by this descent,
Which is the trueborn sovereign this or that,
Father range your battles prate no more,
These English fain would spend the time in words,
That night approaching they might escape unfought,
Lords and my loving subjects nows the time,
That your intended force must bide the touch,
Therefore my friends consider this in brief,
He that you fight for is your natural king,
He against whom you fight a foreigner,
He that you fight for rules in clemency,
And reins you with a mild and gentle bit,
He against whom you fight if he prevail,
Will straight enthrone himself in tyranny,
Make slaves of you and with a heavy hand,
Curtail and curb your sweetest liberty,
Then to protect your country and your king,
Let but the haughty courage of your hearts,
Answer the number of your able hands,
And we shall quickly chase these fugitives,
For whats this Edward but a bellygod,
 tender and lascivious wantonness,
That thother day was almost dead for love,
And what  pray you is his goodly guard,
Such as but scant them of their chines of beef,
And take away their downy featherbeds,
And presently they are as restystiff,
As twere a many overridden jades,
Then Frenchmen scorn that such should be your lords,
And rather bind ye them in captive bands,
Vive le roi God save King John of France,
Now on this plain of Crécy spread yourselves,
And Edward when thou darst begin the fight,
Exeunt King John King of Bohemia and all the French,
We presently will meet thee John of France,
And English lords let us resolve the day,
Either to clear us of that scandalous crime,
Or be entombèd in our innocence,
And Ned because this battle is the first,
That ever yet thou foughtst in pitchèd field,
As ancient custom is of martialists,
To dub thee with the type of chivalry,
In solemn manner we will give thee arms,
Come therefore heralds orderly bring forth,
 strong attirement for the Prince my son,
Enter four heralds bringing in a coat of armor a helmet a,
Edward Plantagenet in the name of God,
As with this armor  impall thy breast,
So be thy noble unrelenting heart,
Walled in with flint of matchless fortitude,
That never base affections enter there,
Fight and be valiant conquer where thou comst,
Now follow lords and do him honor too,
Edward Plantagenet Prince of Wales,
As  do set this helmet on thy head,
Wherewith the chamber of this brain is fenced,
So may thy temples with Bellonas hand,
Be still adorned with laurel victory,
Fight and be valiant conquer where thou comst,
Edward Plantagenet Prince of Wales,
Receive this lance into thy manly hand,
Use it in fashion of a brazen pen,
To draw forth bloody stratagems in France,
And print thy valiant deeds in honors book,
Fight and be valiant conquer where thou comst,
Edward Plantagenet Prince of Wales,
Hold take this target wear it on thy arm,
And may the view thereof like Perseus shield,
Astonish and transform thy gazing foes,
To senseless images of meager death,
Fight and be valiant conquer where thou comst,
Now wants there naught but knighthood which deferred,
We leave till thou hast won it in the field,
My gracious father and ye forward peers,
This honor you have done me animates,
And cheers my green yet scarce appearing strength,
With comfortable goodpresaging signs,
No otherwise than did old Jacobs words,
Whenas he breathed his blessings on his sons,
These hallowed gifts of yours when  prophane,
Or use them not to glory of my God,
To patronage the fatherless and poor,
Or for the benefit of Englands peace,
Be numb my joints wax feeble both mine arms,
Wither my heart that like a sapless tree,
 may remain the map of infamy,
Then thus our steelèd battles shall be ranged,
The leading of the vaward Ned is thine,
To dignify whose lusty spirit the more,
We temper it with Audleys gravity,
That courage and experience joined in one,
Your manage may be second unto none,
For the main battles  will guide myself,
And Derby in the rearward march behind,
That orderly disposed and set in ray,
Let us to horse and God grant us the day,
