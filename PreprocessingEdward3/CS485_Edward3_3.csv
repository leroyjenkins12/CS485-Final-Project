 might perceive his eye in her eye lost,
His ear to drink her sweet tongues utterance,
And changing passions like inconstant clouds,
That rack upon the carriage of the winds,
Increase and die in his disturbèd cheeks,
Lo when she blushed even then did he look pale,
As if her cheeks by some enchanted power,
Attracted had the cherry blood from his,
Anon with reverent fear when she grew pale,
His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments,
But no more like her oriental red,
Than brick to coral or live things to dead,
Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks,
If she did blush twas tender modest shame,
Being in the sacred presence of a king,
If he did blush twas red immodest shame,
To vail his eyes amiss being a king,
If she looked pale twas silly womans fear,
To bear herself in presence of a king,
If he looked pale it was with guilty fear,
To dote amiss being a mighty king,
Then Scottish wars farewell  fear twill prove,
 lingring English siege of peevish love,
Here comes his highness walking all alone,
She is grown more fairer far since  came hither,
Her voice more silver every word than other,
Her wit more fluent what a strange discourse,
Unfolded she of David and his Scots,
Even thus quoth she he spake  and then spoke broad,
With epithets and accents of the Scot,
But somewhat better than the Scot could speak,
And thus quoth she  and answered then herself,
For who could speak like her But she herself,
Breathes from the wall an angels note from heaven,
Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes,
When she would talk of peace methinks her tongue,
Commanded war to prison when of war,
It wakened Caesar from his Roman grave,
To hear war beautified by her discourse,
Wisdom is foolishness but in her tongue,
Beauty a slander but in her fair face,
There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,
Nor frosty winter but in her disdain,
 cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,
For she is all the treasure of our land,
But call them cowards that they ran away,
Having so rich and fair a cause to stay ,
Art thou there Lodwick Give me ink and paper,
And bid the lords hold on their play at chess,
For we will walk and meditate alone,
This fellow is well read in poetry,
And hath a lusty and persuasive spirit,
 will acquaint him with my passion,
Which he shall shadow with a veil of lawn,
Through which the queen of beautys queen shall see,
Herself the ground of my infirmity,
Hast thou pen ink and paper ready Lodowick,
Then in the summer arbor sit by me,
Make it our council house or cabinet,
Since green our thoughts green be the conventicle,
Where we will ease us by disburdning them,
Now Lodwick invocate some golden muse,
To bring thee hither an enchanted pen,
That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,
Talking of grief to make thee ready groan,
And when thou writst of tears encouch the word,
Before and after with such sweet laments,
That it may raise drops in a Tartars eye,
And make a flintheart Scythian pitiful ,
For so much moving hath a poets pen,
Then if thou be a poet move thou so,
And be enrichèd by thy sovereigns love,
For if the touch of sweet concordant strings,
Could force attendance in the ears of hell,
How much more shall the strains of poets wit,
Beguile and ravish soft and humane minds,
To whom my lord shall  direct my style,
To one that shames the fair and sots the wise,
Whose body is an abstract or a brief,
Contains each general virtue in the world,
Better than beautiful thou must begin,
Devise for fair a fairer word than fair,
And every ornament that thou wouldst praise,
Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise,
For flattery fear thou not to be convicted,
For were thy admiration ten times more,
Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds,
Of that thou art to praise thy praises worth,
Begin   will to contemplate the while,
Forget not to set down how passionate,
How heartsick and how full of languishment,
What beauty else could triumph on me,
Or who but women do our lovelays greet,
What thinkst thou  did bid thee praise a horse,
Of what condition or estate she is,
Twere requisite that  should know my lord,
Of such estate that hers is as a throne,
And my estate the footstool where she treads,
Then mayst thou judge what her condition is,
By the proportion of her mightiness,
Write on while  peruse her in my thoughts ,
Her voice to music or the nightingale,
To music every summerleaping swain,
Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks,
And why should  speak of the nightingale,
The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong,
And that compared is too satirical,
For sin though sin would not be so esteemed,
But rather virtue sin sin virtue deemed,
Her hair far softer than the silkworms twist,
Like to a flattering glass doth make more fair,
The yellow amber  like a flattering glass,
Comes in too soon for writing of her eyes,
Ill say that like a glass they catch the sun,
And thence the hot reflection doth rebound,
Against my breast and burns my heart within,
Ah what a world of descant makes my soul,
Upon this voluntary ground of love,
Come Lodwick hast thou turned thy ink to gold,
If not write but in letters capital,
My mistress name and it will gild thy paper,
Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears,
With the sweet hearing of thy poetry,
 have not to a period brought her praise,
Her praise is as my love both infinite,
Which apprehend such violent extremes,
That they disdain an ending period,
Her beauty hath no match but my affection,
Hers more than most mine most and more than more,
Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,
Nay more than drop the massy earth by sands,
And sand by sand print them in memory,
Then wherefore talkst thou of a period,
To that which craves unended admiration,
More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades ,
That line hath two faults gross and palpable,
Comparst thou her to the pale queen of night,
Who being set in dark seems therefore light,
What is she when the sun lifts up his head,
But like a fading taper dim and dead,
My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,
And being unmasked outshine the golden sun,
What is the other fault my sovereign lord,
 did not bid thee talk of chastity,
To ransack so the treasure of her mind,
For  had rather have her chased than chaste,
Out with the moon line  will none of it,
And let me have her likened to the sun,
Say she hath thrice more splendor than the sun,
That her perfections emulates the sun,
That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,
That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,
That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,
That she doth dazzle gazers like the sun,
And in this application to the sun,
Bid her be free and general as the sun,
Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows,
As lovingly as on the fragrant rose,
Lets see what follows that same moonlight line,
More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,
Oh monstrous line Put in the next a sword,
And  shall woo her to cut off my head,
Blot blot good Lodwick let us hear the next,
 thank thee then thou hast done little ill,
But what is done is passing passing ill,
No let the captain talk of boistrous war,
The prisoner of immurèd dark constraint,
The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,
The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,
The frozen soul the benefit of fire,
And every grief his happy opposite,
Love cannot sound well but in lovers tongues,
Give me the pen and paper  will write,
But soft here comes the treasurer of my spirit ,
Lodwick thou knowst not how to draw a battle,
These wings these flankers and these squadrons,
Argue in thee defective discipline,
Thou shouldst have placed this here this other here,
Pardon my boldness my thrice gracious lords,
Let my intrusion here be called my duty,
That comes to see my sovereign how he fares,
Go draw the same  tell thee in what form,
Sorry  am to see my liege so sad,
What may thy subject do to drive from thee,
Thy gloomy consort sullen melancholy,
Ah lady  am blunt and cannot strew,
The flowers of solace in a ground of shame,
Since  came hither Countess  am wronged,
Now God forbid that any in my house,
Should think my sovereign wrong Thrice gentle king,
Acquaint me with your cause of discontent,
How near then shall  be to remedy,
As near my liege as all my womans power,
Can pawn itself to buy thy remedy,
If thou speakst true then have  my redress,
Engage thy power to redeem my joys,
And  am joyful Countess else  die,
Swear Countess that thou wilt,
Then take thyself a little way aside,
And tell thyself a king doth dote on thee,
Say that within thy power doth lie,
To make him happy and that thou hast sworn,
To give him all the joy within thy power,
Do this and tell me when  shall be happy,
All this is done my thrice dread sovereign,
That power of love that  have power to give,
Thou hast with all devout obedience,
Employ me how thou wilt in proof thereof,
Thou hearst me say that  do dote on thee,
If on my beauty take it if thou canst,
Though little  do prize it ten times less,
If on my virtue take it if thou canst,
For virtues store by giving doth augment,
Be it on what it will that  can give,
And thou canst take away inherit it,
It is thy beauty that  would enjoy,
Oh were it painted  would wipe it off,
And dispossess myself to give it thee,
But sovereign it is soldered to my life,
Take one and both for like an humble shadow,
It haunts the sunshine of my summers life,
But thou mayst leave it me to sport withal,
As easy may my intellectual soul,
Be lent away and yet my body live,
As lend my body palace to my soul,
Away from her and yet retain my soul,
My body is her bower her court her abbey,
And she an angel pure divine unspotted,
If  should leave her house my lord to thee,
 kill my poor soul and my poor soul me,
Didst thou not swear to give me what  would,
 did my liege so what you would  could,
 wish no more of thee than thou mayst give,
Nor beg  do not but  rather buy ,
That is thy love and for that love of thine,
In rich exchange  tender to thee mine,
But that your lips were sacred my lord,
You would prophane the holy name of love,
That love you offer me you cannot give,
For Caesar owes that tribute to his queen,
That love you beg of me  cannot give,
For Sarah owes that duty to her lord,
He that doth clip or counterfeit your stamp,
Shall die my lord and will your sacred self,
Commit high treason against the king of heaven,
To stamp his image in forbidden metal,
Forgetting your allegiance and your oath,
In violating marriage sacred law,
You break a greater honor than yourself,
To be a king is of a younger house,
Than to be married your progenitor,
Sole reigning Adam on the universe,
By God was honored for a married man,
But not by him anointed for a king,
It is a penalty to break your statutes,
Though not enacted with your highness hand,
How much more to infringe the holy act,
Made by the mouth of God sealed with His hand,
 know my sovereign in my husbands love,
Who now doth loyal service in his wars,
Doth but to try the wife of Salisbury,
Whether she will hear a wantons tale or no,
Lest being therein guilty by my stay,
From that not from my liege  turn away,
Whether is her beauty by her words divine,
Or are her words sweet chaplains to her beauty,
Like as the wind doth beautify a sail,
And as a sail becomes the unseen wind,
So do her words her beauty beauty words,
Oh that  were a honeygathering bee,
To bear the comb of virtue from this flower,
And not a poisonsucking envious spider,
To turn the juice  take to deadly venom,
Religion is austere and beauty gentle,
Too strict a guardian for so fair a ward,
Oh that she were as is the air to me,
Why so she is for when  would embrace her,
This do  and catch nothing but myself,
 must enjoy her for  cannot beat,
With reason and reproof fond love away,
Here comes her father  will work with him,
To bear my colors in this field of love,
How is it that my sovereign is so sad,
May  with pardon know your highness grief,
And that my old endeavor will remove it,
It shall not cumber long your majesty,
 kind and voluntary gift thou profferest,
That  was forward to have begged of thee,
But  thou world great nurse of flattery,
Why dost thou tip mens tongues with golden words,
And peise their deeds with weight of heavy lead,
That fair performance cannot follow promise,
Oh that a man might hold the hearts close book,
And choke the lavish tongue when it doth utter,
The breath of falsehood not charactered there,
Far be it from the honor of my age,
That  should owe bright gold and render lead,
Age is a cynic not a flatterer,
 say again that if  knew your grief,
And that by me it may be lessenèd,
My proper harm should buy your highness good,
These are the vulgar tenders of false men,
That never pay the duty of their words,
Thou wilt not stick to swear what thou hast said,
But when thou knowest my griefs condition,
This rash disgorgèd vomit of thy word,
Thou wilt eat up again and leave me helpless,
By heaven  will not though your majesty,
Did bid me run upon your sword and die,
Say that my grief is no way medicinable,
But by the loss and bruising of thine honor,
If nothing but that loss may vantage you,
 would account that loss my vantage too,
Thinkst that thou canst answer thy oath again,
 cannot nor  would not if  could,
But if thou dost what shall  say to thee,
What may be said to any perjured villain,
That breaks the sacred warrant of an oath,
What wilt thou say to one that breaks an oath,
That he hath broke his faith with God and man,
And from them both stands excommunicate,
What office were it to suggest a man,
To break a lawful and religious vow,
An office for the devil not for man,
That devils office must thou do for me,
Or break thy oath or cancel all the bonds,
Of love and duty twixt thyself and me,
And therefore Warwick if thou art thyself,
The lord and master of thy word and oath,
Go to thy daughter and in my behalf,
Command her woo her win her any ways,
To be my mistress and my secret love,
 will not stand to hear thee make reply ,
Thy oath break hers or let thy sovereign die,
 doting king  detestable office,
Well may  tempt myself to wrong myself,
When he hath sworn me by the name of God,
To break a vow made by the name of God,
What if  swear by this right hand of mine,
To cut this right hand off The better way,
Were to prophane the idol than confound it,
But neither will  do Ill keep mine oath,
And to my daughter make a recantation,
Of all the virtue  have preached to her,
Ill say she must forget her husband Salisbury,
If she remember to embrace the King,
Ill say an oath may easily be broken,
But not so easily pardoned being broken,
Ill say it is true charity to love,
But not true love to be so charitable,
Ill say his greatness may bear out the shame,
But not his kingdom can buy out the sin,
Ill say it is my duty to persuade,
But not her honesty to give consent,
See where she comes was never father had,
Against his child an embassage so bad,
My lord and father  have sought for you,
My mother and the peers importune you,
To keep in presence of his majesty,
And do your best to make his highness merry,
Aside How shall  enter in this graceless errand,
 must not call her child for wheres the father,
That will in such a suit seduce his child,
Then wife of Salisbury shall  so begin,
No hes my friend and where is found the friend,
That will do friendship such endamagement ,
To Countess Neither my daughter nor my dear friends wife,
 am not Warwick as thou thinkst  am,
But an attorney from the court of hell,
That thus have housed my spirit in his form,
To do a message to thee from the King,
The mighty King of England dotes on thee,
He that hath power to take away thy life,
Hath power to take thine honor then consent,
To pawn thine honor rather than thy life,
Honor is often lost and got again,
But life once gone hath no recovery,
The sun that withers hay doth nourish grass,
The King that would distain thee will advance thee,
The poets write that great Achilles spear,
Could heal the wound it made the moral is,
What mighty men misdo they can amend,
The lion doth become his bloody jaws,
And grace his foragement by being mild,
When vassal fear lies trembling at his feet,
The King will in his glory hide thy shame,
And those that gaze on him to find out thee,
Will lose their eyesight looking in the sun,
What can one drop of poison harm the sea,
Whose hugy vastures can digest the ill,
And make it lose his operation,
The Kings great name will temper thy misdeeds,
And give the bitter potion of reproach,
 sugared sweet and most delicious taste,
Besides it is no harm to do the thing,
Which without shame could not be left undone,
Thus have  in his majestys behalf,
Apparelled sin in virtuous sentences,
And dwell upon thy answer in his suit,
Unnatural besiege Woe me unhappy,
To have escaped the danger of my foes,
And to be ten times worse envired by friends,
Hath he no means to stain my honest blood,
But to corrupt the author of my blood,
To be his scandalous and vile solicitor,
No marvel though the branches be then infected,
When poison hath encompassèd the root,
No marvel though the leprous infant die,
When the stern dame envenometh the dug,
Why then give sin a passport to offend,
And youth the dangerous reign of liberty,
Blot out the strict forbidding of the law,
And cancel every canon that prescribes,
 shame for shame or penance for offence,
No let me die if his too boistrous will,
Will have it so before  will consent,
To be an actor in his graceless lust,
Why now thou speakst as  would have thee speak,
And mark how  unsay my words again,
An honorable grave is more esteemed,
Than the polluted closet of a king,
The greater man the greater is the thing,
Be it good or bad that he shall undertake,
An unreputed mote flying in the sun,
Presents a greater substance than it is,
The freshest summers day doth soonest taint,
The loathèd carrion that it seems to kiss,
Deep are the blows made with a mighty axe,
That sin doth ten times aggravate itself,
That is committed in a holy place,
Is sin and subornation deck an ape,
In tissue and the beauty of the robe,
Adds but the greater scorn unto the beast,
 spacious field of reasons could  urge,
Between his glory daughter and thy shame,
That poison shows worst in a golden cup,
Dark night seems darker by the lightning flash,
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds,
And every glory that inclines to sin,
The shame is treble by the opposite,
So leave  with my blessing in thy bosom,
Which then convert to a most heavy curse,
When thou convertst from honors golden name,
To the black faction of bedblotting shame,
Ill follow thee and when my mind turns so,
My body sink my soul in endless woe,
