Now John in France and lately John of France,
Thy bloody ensigns are my captive colors,
And you high vaunting Charles of Normandy,
That once today sent me a horse to fly,
Are now the subjects of my clemency,
Fie lords ist not a shame that English boys,
Whose early days are yet not worth a beard,
Should in the bosom of your kingdom thus,
One against twenty beat you up together,
Thy fortune not thy force hath conquered us,
An argument that heaven aids the right,
Enter Artois with Philip as prisoner,
See see Artois doth bring with him along,
The late good counselgiver to my soul,
Welcome Artois and welcome Philip too,
Who now of you or  have need to pray,
Now is the proverb verified in you,
Too bright a morning breeds a louring day,
Sound trumpets enter Audley led by the two Esquires,
But say what grim discouragement comes here,
Alas what thousand armèd men of France,
Have writ that note of death in Audleys face,
Speak thou that woost death with thy careless smile,
And lookst so merrily upon thy grave,
As if thou wert enamored on thine end,
What hungry sword hath so bereaved thy face,
And lopped a true friend from my loving soul,
 Prince thy sweet bemoaning speech to me,
Is as a mournful knell to one dead sick,
Dear Audley if my tongue ring out thy end,
My arms shall be thy grave What may  do,
To win thy life or to revenge thy death,
If thou wilt drink the blood of captive kings,
Or that it were restorative command,
 health of kings blood and Ill drink to thee,
If honor may dispense for thee with death,
The neverdying honor of this day,
Share wholly Audley to thyself and live,
Victorious Prince that thou art so behold,
 caesars fame in kings captivity,
If  could hold dim death but at a bay,
Till  did see my liege thy royal father,
My soul should yield this castle of my flesh,
This mangled tribute with all willingness,
To darkness consummation dust and worms,
Cheerily bold man thy soul is all too proud,
To yield her city for one little breach,
Should be divorcèd from her earthly spouse,
By the soft temper of a Frenchmans sword,
Lo to repair thy life  give to thee,
Three thousand marks a year in English land,
 take thy gift to pay the debts  owe,
These two poor esquires redeemed me from the French,
With lusty and dear hazard of their lives,
What thou hast given me  give to them,
And as thou lovst me Prince lay thy consent,
To this bequeath in my last testament,
Renownèd Audley live and have from me,
This gift twice doubled to these esquires and thee,
But live or die what thou hast given away,
To these and theirs shall lasting freedom stay,
Come gentlemen  will see my friend bestowed,
Within an easy litter then well march,
Proudly toward Calais with triumphant pace,
Unto my royal father and there bring,
The tribute of my wars fair France his king,
