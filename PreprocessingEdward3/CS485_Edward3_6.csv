Well met my masters How now whats the news,
And wherefore are ye laden thus with stuff,
What is it quarter day that you remove,
Quarter day ay and quartering day  fear,
Have ye not heard the news that flies abroad,
How the French navy is destroyed at sea,
And that the English army is arrived,
What then quoth you Why ist not time to fly,
When envy and destruction is so nigh,
Content thee man they are far enough from hence,
And will be met  warrant ye to their cost,
Before they break so far into the realm,
Ay so the grasshopper doth spend the time,
In mirthful jollity till winter come,
And then too late he would redeem his time,
When frozen cold hath nipped his careless head,
He that no sooner will provide a cloak,
Than when he sees it doth begin to rain,
May peradventure for his negligence,
Be throughly washed when he suspects it not,
We that have charge and such a train as this,
Must look in time to look for them and us,
Lest when we would we cannot be relieved,
Belike you then despair of ill success,
And think your country will be subjugate,
We cannot tell tis good to fear the worst,
Yet rather fight than like unnatural sons,
Forsake your loving parents in distress,
Tush they that have already taken arms,
Are many fearful millions in respect,
Of that small handful of our enemies,
But tis a rightful quarrel must prevail,
Edward is son unto our late kings sister,
Where John Valois is three degrees removed,
Besides there goes a prophecy abroad,
Published by one that was a friar once,
Whose oracles have many times proved true,
And now he says the time will shortly come,
Whenas a lion rous√®d in the west,
Shall carry hence the fleurdelis of France,
These  can tell ye and such like surmises,
Strike many Frenchmen cold unto the heart,
Fly countrymen and citizens of France,
Sweet flowring peace the root of happy life,
Is quite abandoned and expulsed the land,
Instead of whom ransackconstraining war,
Sits like to ravens upon your houses tops,
Slaughter and mischief walk within your streets,
And unrestrained make havoc as they pass,
The form whereof even now myself beheld,
Upon this fair mountain whence  came,
For so far off as  directed mine eyes,
 might perceive five cities all on fire,
Cornfields and vineyards burning like an oven,
And as the leaking vapor in the wind,
Turned but aside  likewise might discern,
The poor inhabitants escaped the flame,
Fall numberless upon the soldiers pikes,
Three ways these dreadful ministers of wrath,
Do tread the measures of their tragic march,
Upon the right hand comes the conquering king,
Upon the left his hot unbridled son,
And in the midst their nations glittering host,
All which though distant yet conspire in one,
To leave a desolation where they come,
Fly therefore citizens If you be wise,
Seek out some habitation further off,
Here if you stay your wives will be abused,
Your treasure shared before your weeping eyes,
Shelter yourselves for now the storm doth rise,
Away away Methinks  hear their drums,
Ah wretched France  greatly fear thy fall,
Thy glory shaketh like a tottering wall,
