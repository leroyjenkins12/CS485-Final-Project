Here till our navy of a thousand sail,
Have made a breakfast to our foe by sea,
Let us encamp to wait their happy speed,
Lorraine what readiness is Edward in,
How hast thou heard that he provided is,
Of martial furniture for this exploit,
To lay aside unnecessary soothing,
And not to spend the time in circumstance,
Tis bruited for a certainty my lord,
That hes exceeding strongly fortified,
His subjects flock as willingly to war,
As if unto a triumph they were led,
England was wont to harbor malcontents,
Bloodthirsty and seditious Catilines,
Spendthrifts and such as gape for nothing else,
But changing and alteration of the state,
All but the Scot who solemnly protests,
As heretofore  have informed his grace,
Never to sheathe his sword or take a truce,
Ah thats the anchrage of some better hope,
But on the other side to think what friends,
King Edward hath retained in Netherland,
Among those everbibbing epicures ,
Those frothy Dutchmen puffed with double beer,
That drink and swill in every place they come ,
Doth not a little aggravate mine ire,
Besides we hear the emperor conjoins,
And stalls him in his own authority,
But all the mightier that their number is,
The greater glory reaps the victory,
Some friends have we beside domestic power,
The stern Polonian and the warlike Dane,
The King of Bohemia and of Sicily,
Are all become confederates with us,
And as  think are marching hither apace,
But soft  hear the music of their drums,
By which  guess that their approach is near,
Enter the King of Bohemia with Danes and a Polonian Captain,
with other soldiers another way,
King John of France as league and neighborhood,
Requires when friends are any way distressed,
 come to aid thee with my countrys force,
And from great Moscow fearful to the Turk,
And lofty Poland nurse of hardy men,
 bring these servitors to fight for thee,
Who willingly will venture in thy cause,
Welcome Bohemian King and welcome all,
This your great kindness  will not forget,
Besides your plentiful rewards in crowns,
That from our treasury ye shall receive,
There comes a harebrained nation decked in pride,
The spoil of whom will be a treble gain,
And now my hope is full my joy complete,
At sea we are as puissant as the force,
Of Agamemnon in the haven of Troy,
By land with Xerxes we compare of strength,
Whose soldiers drank up rivers in their thirst,
Then Bayardlike blind overweening Ned,
To reach at our imperial diadem,
Is either to be swallowed of the waves,
Or hacked apieces when thou comst ashore,
Near to the coast  have descried my lord,
As  was busy in my watchful charge,
The proud armada of King Edwards ships,
Which at the first far off when  did ken,
Seemed as it were a grove of withered pines,
But drawing near their glorious bright aspect,
Their streaming ensigns wrought of colored silk,
Like to a meadow full of sundry flowers,
Adorns the naked bosom of the earth,
Majestical the order of their course,
Figuring the hornèd circle of the moon,
And on the top gallant of the admiral,
And likewise all the handmaids of his train,
The arms of England and of France unite,
Are quartered equally by heralds art,
Thus titely carried with a merry gale,
They plough the ocean hitherward amain,
Dare he already crop the fleurdelis,
 hope the honey being gathered thence,
He with the spider afterward approached,
Shall suck forth deadly venom from the leaves,
But wheres our navy How are they prepared,
To wing themselves against this flight of ravens,
They having knowledge brought them by the scouts,
Did break from anchor straight and puffed with rage,
No otherwise than were their sails with wind,
Made forth as when the empty eagle flies,
To satisfy his hungry griping maw,
Theres for thy news return unto thy bark,
And if thou scape the bloody stroke of war,
And do survive the conflict come again,
And let us hear the manner of the fight,
Mean space my lords tis best we be dispersed,
To several places lest they chance to land,
First you my lord with your Bohemian troops,
Shall pitch your battles on the lower hand,
My eldest son the Duke of Normandy,
Together with this aid of Muscovites,
Shall climb the higher ground another way,
Here in the middle coast betwixt you both,
Philip my youngest boy and  will lodge,
So lords begone and look unto your charge,
You stand for France an empire fair and large,
Exeunt all except King John and Philip,
Now tell me Philip what is thy conceit,
Touching the challenge that the English make,
 say my lord claim Edward what he can,
And bring he neer so plain a pedigree,
Tis you are in possession of the crown,
And thats the surest point of all the law,
But were it not yet ere he should prevail,
Ill make a conduit of my dearest blood,
Or chase those straggling upstarts home again,
Well said young Philip Call for bread and wine,
That we may cheer our stomachs with repast,
To look our foes more sternly in the face,
Now is begun the heavy day at sea,
Fight Frenchmen fight be like the field of bears,
When they defend their younglings in their caves,
Steer angry Nemesis the happy helm,
That with the sulphur battles of your rage,
The English fleet may be dispersed and sunk,
 father how this echoing cannon shot,
Like sweet harmony digests my cates,
Now boy thou hearst what thundring terror tis,
To buckle for a kingdoms sovereignty,
The earth with giddy trembling when it shakes,
Or when the exhalations of the air,
Breaks in extremity of lightning flash,
Affrights not more than kings when they dispose,
To show the rancor of their highswolln hearts,
Retreat is sounded one side hath the worse,
Oh if it be the French sweet Fortune turn,
And in thy turning change the froward winds,
That with advantage of a favoring sky,
Our men may vanquish and thother fly,
My heart misgives  say mirror of pale death,
To whom belongs the honor of this day,
Relate  pray thee if thy breath will serve,
The sad discourse of this discomfiture,
My gracious sovereign France hath taen the foil,
And boasting Edward triumphs with success,
When last  was reporter to your grace,
Both full of angry spleen of hope and fear,
Hasting to meet each other in the face,
At last conjoined and by their admiral,
Our admiral encountered many shot,
By this the other that beheld these twain,
Give earnest penny of a further wrack,
Like fiery dragons took their haughty flight,
And likewise meeting from their smoky wombs,
Sent many grim ambassadors of death,
Then gan the day to turn to gloomy night,
And darkness did as well enclose the quick,
As those that were but newly reft of life,
No leisure served for friends to bid farewell,
And if it had the hideous noise was such,
As each to other seemèd deaf and dumb,
Purple the sea whose channel filled as fast,
With streaming gore that from the maimèd fell,
As did her gushing moisture break into,
The crannied cleftures of the throughshot planks,
Here flew a head dissevered from the trunk,
There mangled arms and legs were tossed aloft,
As when a whirlwind takes the summer dust,
And scatters it in middle of the air,
Then might ye see the reeling vessels split,
And tottering sink into the ruthless flood,
Until their lofty tops were seen no more,
All shifts were tried both for defence and hurt,
And now the effect of valor and of force,
Of resolution and of cowardice,
Were lively pictured how the one for fame,
The other by compulsion laid about,
Much did the Nompareille that brave ship,
So did the black snake of Boulogne than which,
 bonnier vessel never yet spread sail,
But all in vain both sun the wind and tide,
Revolted all unto our foemens side,
That we perforce were fain to give them way,
And they are landed Thus my tale is done,
We have untimely lost and they have won,
Then rests there nothing but with present speed,
To join our several forces all in one,
And bid them battle ere they range too far,
Come gentle Philip let us hence depart,
This soldiers words have pierced thy fathers heart,
