Robert of Artois banished though thou be,
From France thy native country yet with us,
Thou shalt retain as great a seigniory,
For we create thee Earl of Richmond here,
And now go forwards with our pedigree,
Who next succeeded Philip le Beau,
Three sons of his which all successively,
Did sit upon their fathers regal throne,
Yet died and left no issue of their loins,
But was my mother sister unto those,
She was my lord and only Isabel,
Was all the daughters that this Philip had,
Whom afterward your father took to wife,
And from the fragrant garden of her womb,
Your gracious self the flower of Europes hope,
Derivèd is inheritor to France,
But note the rancor of rebellious minds,
When thus the lineage of le Beau was out,
The French obscured your mothers privilege,
And though she were the next of blood proclaimed,
John of the house of Valois now their king,
The reason was they say the realm of France,
Replete with princes of great parentage,
Ought not admit a governor to rule,
Except he be descended of the male,
And thats the special ground of their contempt,
Wherewith they study to exclude your grace,
But they shall find that forgèd ground of theirs,
To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand,
Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,
That  a Frenchman should discover this,
But heaven  call to record of my vows,
It is not hate nor any private wrong,
But love unto my country and the right,
Provokes my tongue thus lavish in report,
You are the lineal watchman of our peace,
And John of Valois indirectly climbs,
What then should subjects but embrace their king,
Ah wherein may our duty more be seen,
Than striving to rebate a tyrants pride,
And place the true shepherd of our commonwealth,
This counsel Artois like to fruitful showers,
Hath added growth unto my dignity,
And by the fiery vigor of thy words,
Hot courage is engendered in my breast,
Which heretofore was racked in ignorance,
But now doth mount with golden wings of fame,
And will approve fair Isabels descent,
Able to yoke their stubborn necks with steel,
That spurn against my sovereignty in France,
 messenger  Lord Audley know from whence,
The Duke of Lorraine having crossed the seas,
Entreats he may have conference with your highness,
Admit him lords that we may hear the news ,
Say Duke of Lorraine wherefore art thou come,
The most renownèd prince King John of France,
Doth greet thee Edward and by me commands,
That for so much as by his liberal gift,
The Guienne dukedom is entailed to thee,
Thou do him lowly homage for the same,
And for that purpose here  summon thee,
Repair to France within these forty days,
That there according as the custom is,
Thou mayst be sworn true liegeman to our king,
Or else thy title in that province dies,
And he himself will repossess the place,
See how occasion laughs me in the face,
No sooner minded to prepare for France,
But straight  am invited nay with threats,
Upon a penalty enjoined to come,
Twere but a childish part to say him nay,
Lorraine return this answer to thy lord,
 mean to visit him as he requests,
But how Not servilely disposed to bend,
But like a conqueror to make him bow,
His lame unpolished shifts are come to light,
And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face,
That set a gloss upon his arrogance,
Dare he command a fealty in me,
Tell him the crown that he usurps is mine,
And where he sets his foot he ought to kneel,
Tis not a petty dukedom that  claim,
But all the whole dominions of the realm,
Which if with grudging he refuse to yield,
Ill take away those borrowed plumes of his,
And send him naked to the wilderness,
Then Edward here in spite of all thy lords,
 do pronounce defiance to thy face,
Defiance Frenchman We rebound it back,
Even to the bottom of thy masters throat,
And be it spoke with reverence of the King,
My gracious father and these other lords,
 hold thy message but as scurrilous,
And him that sent thee like the lazy drone,
Crept up by stealth unto the eagles nest,
From whence well shake him with so rough a storm,
As others shall be warnèd by his harm,
Bid him leave off the lions case he wears,
Lest meeting with the lion in the field,
He chance to tear him piecemeal for his pride,
The soundest counsel  can give his grace,
Is to surrender ere he be constrained,
 voluntary mischief hath less scorn,
Than when reproach with violence is born,
Degenerate traitor viper to the place,
Where thou wast fostered in thine infancy,
Bearst thou a part in this conspiracy,
Drawing his sword Lorraine behold the sharpness of this steel,
Fervent desire that sits against my heart,
Is far more thornypricking than this blade,
That with the nightingale  shall be scarred,
As oft as  dispose myself to rest,
Until my colors be displayed in France,
This is thy final answer so be gone,
It is not that nor any English brave,
Afflicts me so as doth his poisoned view,
That is most false should most of all be true,
Now Lord our fleeting bark is under sail,
Our gage is thrown and war is soon begun,
But not so quickly brought unto an end,
But wherefore comes Sir William Montague,
How stands the league between the Scot and us,
Cracked and dissevered my renownèd lord,
The treacherous king no sooner was informed,
Of your withdrawing of your army back,
But straight forgetting of his former oath,
He made invasion on the bordering towns,
Berwick is won Newcastle spoiled and lost,
And now the tyrant hath begirt with siege,
The castle of Roxborough where enclosed,
The Countess Salisbury is like to perish,
That is thy daughter Warwick is it not,
Whose husband hath in Brittany served so long,
About the planting of Lord Mountford there,
Ignoble David hast thou none to grieve,
But silly ladies with thy threatning arms,
But  will make you shrink your snaily horns,
First therefore Audley this shall be thy charge,
Go levy footmen for our wars in France,
And Ned take muster of our men at arms,
In every shire elect a several band,
Let them be soldiers of a lusty spirit,
Such as dread nothing but dishonors blot,
Be wary therefore since we do commence,
 famous war and with so mighty a nation,
Derby be thou ambassador for us,
Unto our fatherinlaw the Earl of Hainault,
Make him acquainted with our enterprise,
And likewise will him with our own allies,
That are in Flanders to solicit too,
The Emperor of Allemagne in our name,
Myself whilst you are jointly thus employed,
Will with these forces that  have at hand,
March and once more repulse the traitorous Scot,
But sirs be resolute we shall have wars,
On every side and Ned thou must begin,
Now to forget thy study and thy books,
And ure thy shoulders to an armors weight,
As cheerful sounding to my youthful spleen,
This tumult is of wars increasing broils,
The joyful clamors of the people are,
When Ave Caesar they pronounce aloud,
Within this school of honor  shall learn,
Either to sacrifice my foes to death,
Or in a rightful quarrel spend my breath,
Then cheerfully forward each a several way,
In great affairs tis naught to use delay,
