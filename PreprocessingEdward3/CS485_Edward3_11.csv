 wonder Villiers thou shouldst importune me,
For one that is our deadly enemy,
Not for his sake my gracious lord so much,
Am  become an earnest advocate,
As that thereby my ransom will be quit,
Thy ransom man Why needst thou talk of that,
Art thou not free And are not all occasions,
That happen for advantage of our foes,
To be accepted of and stood upon,
No good my lord except the same be just,
For profit must with honor be commixed,
Or else our actions are but scandalous,
But letting pass these intricate objections,
Willt please your highness to subscribe or no,
Villiers  will not nor  cannot do it,
Salisbury shall not have his will so much,
To claim a passport how it pleaseth himself,
Why then  know the extremity my lord,
 must return to prison whence  came,
What bird that hath escaped the fowlers gin,
Will not beware how shes ensnared again,
Or what is he so senseless and secure,
That having hardly passed a dangerous gulf,
Will put himself in peril there again,
Ah but it is mine oath my gracious lord,
Which  in conscience may not violate,
Or else a kingdom should not draw me hence,
Thine oath Why that doth bind thee to abide,
Hast thou not sworn obedience to thy prince,
In all things that uprightly he commands,
But either to persuade or threaten me,
Not to perform the covenant of my word,
Is lawless and  need not to obey,
Why is it lawful for a man to kill,
And not to break a promise with his foe,
To kill my lord when war is once proclaimed,
So that our quarrel be for wrongs received,
No doubt is lawfully permitted us,
But in an oath we must be well advised,
How we do swear and when we once have sworn,
Not to infringe it though we die therefor,
Therefore my lord as willing  return,
As if  were to fly to paradise,
Stay my Villiers thine honorable mind,
Deserves to be eternally admired,
Thy suit shall be no longer thus deferred ,
Give me the paper Ill subscribe to it,
And wheretofore  loved thee as Villiers,
Hereafter Ill embrace thee as myself,
Stay and be still in favor with thy lord,
 humbly thank your grace  must dispatch,
And send this passport first unto the earl,
And then  will attend your highness pleasure,
Do so Villiers and Charles when he hath need,
Be such his soldiers howsoever he speed,
Come Charles and arm thee Edward is entrapped,
The Prince of Wales is falln into our hands,
And we have compassed him  he cannot scape,
But will your highness fight today,
What else my son Hes scarce eight thousand strong,
And we are threescore thousand at the least,
 have a prophecy my gracious lord,
Wherein is written what success is like,
To happen us in this outrageous war,
It was delivered me at Cr√©cys field,
By one that is an aged hermit there,
Reads When feathered fowl shall make thine army tremble,
And flintstones rise and break the battle ray,
Then think on him that doth not now dissemble,
For that shall be the hapless dreadful day,
Yet in the end thy foot thou shalt advance,
As far in England as thy foe in France,
By this it seems we shall be fortunate,
For as it is impossible that stones,
Should ever rise and break the battle ray,
Or airy fowl make men in arms to quake,
So is it like we shall not be subdued,
Or say this might be true yet in the end,
Since he doth promise we shall drive him hence,
And forage their country as they have done ours,
By this revenge that loss will seem the less,
But all are frivolous fancies toys and dreams,
Once we are sure we have ensnared the son,
Catch we the father after how we can,
